    "description": "\n                    The Real Estate Investment Underwriter is a core decision-maker responsible for evaluating residential properties across multiple exit strategies to determine whether a deal meets the company’s investment criteria. This role directly impacts company profitability by validating assumptions, stress-testing scenarios, and ensuring every approved deal has a clear, executable path to profit.  The Underwriter is the gatekeeper of company profitability. Every deal we do, or avoid, starts with this role. Strong underwriting protects the company from bad investments and ensures capital is deployed only where risk is understood and returns are justified.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Underwriter analyzes properties under three primary scenarios:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Off-Market / Investor Sale (Cash)\n\r\n2) On-Market / As-Is Condition\n\r\n3) On-Market / Renovate & Resell at After Repair Value (ARV)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not theoretical — your numbers drive real capital deployment and are utilized for critical decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ideal DISC style is a High C / Mid D / Moderate S / Moderate I - someone who is obsessed with accuracy and data integrity, naturally skeptical of assumptions, strong at risk identification, comfortable slowing things down to get the numbers right, process oriented and analytical, loves numbers, and questions everything.  This person should be able to work independently and take ownership of outcomes while being able to defend their analysis/numbers if a deal does not work.  \n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nInvestment Analysis & Deal Underwriting\n\r\n- Analyze residential properties to determine as-is value, investor value (off market), and After Repair Value (ARV)\n\r\n- Run detailed financial models for multiple exit strategies\n\r\n- Validate deal viability using company investment criteria (returns, risk, timelines)\n\r\n- Stress-test assumptions (pricing, repairs, hold time, market shifts)\n\r\n- Clearly determine DEAL / NO DEAL decisions on opportunities\n\r\n\n\r\nValuation & Market Analysis\n\r\n- Pull, analyze, and interpret comparable sales (on-market and off-market)\n\r\n- Adjust comps accurately for condition, location, timing, and renovations\n\r\n- Track market trends and pricing shifts to ensure current, defensible valuations\n\r\n- Evaluate neighborhood-level risk and liquidity\n\r\n\n\r\nRehab & Cost Analysis\n\r\n- Verify repair assumptions align with resale strategy and buyer expectations\n\r\n- Apply appropriate contingency and cost buffers to protect margins\n\r\n\n\r\nProfitability & Risk Management\n\r\n- Ensure every approved deal meets required profit margins and return thresholds\n\r\n- Account for all costs: acquisition, rehab, holding, financing, selling, and overhead\n\r\n- Identify deal-breakers early to protect time, capital, and resources\n\r\n- Flag high-risk variables before commitment\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication & Decision Support\n\r\n- Present underwriting conclusions clearly to acquisitions, leadership, and partners\n\r\n- Defend valuations and assumptions with data and logic\n\r\n- Provide quick, confident feedback to support fast decision-making\n\r\n- Maintain underwriting documentation for accountability and post-deal review\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\r\n- 2–5+ years in real estate underwriting, investing, acquisitions, or valuation\n\r\n- Strong understanding of:\n\r\n     - After Repair Value (ARV) methodology\n\r\n     - Investor pricing models (70% rule, margin-based underwriting, etc.)\n\r\n     - Rehab cost estimation\n\r\n     - Holding costs and deal timelines\n\r\n- Advanced proficiency in Excel / Google Sheets (financial modeling required)\n\r\n- Deep familiarity with MLS data, comps, and market analysis\n\r\n- Ability to thoroughly underwrite deals with detailed accuracy\n\r\n- High attention to detail with strong judgment under pressure\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Traits\n\r\n- Profit-driven thinker – understands that numbers = real dollars at risk\n\r\n- Decisive but disciplined – confident making DEAL / NO DEAL decisions\n\r\n- Skeptical by nature – pressure-tests assumptions instead of accepting them\n\r\n- Process-oriented – consistent underwriting methodology\n\r\n- Ownership mindset – treats company capital like their own\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\nPay rate: $8-$10 per hour, based on experience, plus bonus \n\r\nSchedule: 40 hours per week (It could be more based on workload)\n\r\nTraining: Yes, training will be provided.

We're looking for data entry VA's, team leaders, managers, video editors, media buyers, and project leads.\n\r\n\n\r\nPay starts at $600 a month and increases with performance. We reward performance and timeliness. \n\r\n\n\r\nRoles currently available:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Business Center Creators:  You will be responsible for creating TikTok business centers daily for us that we run ads on. Everything is clearly defined, and simple to execute. SOPs that teach everything take 30 minutes to finish. Only real qualifying trait we're looking for is full availability during working hours to communicate with team, and attention to detail. Fast workers will be able to create 6 business centers an hour, normal workers around 4 an hour. We're looking for fast.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Form Creators: You will work with the business center creators above to populate each business center with forms (standard TikTok advertising options) following our instructions. \n\r\n\n\r\n3. Campaign Creators: You'll create campaigns inside the business centers. Gaming computer needed here because it's simple task but needs lots of tabs open. If computer is weak, that's the bottleneck. (example: on a decent computer it takes 5 minutes to do this task, on a slow computer can take 30)\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Top Up Specialists: High trust position, highest pay. You'll be trusted with our credit cards and asked to top up the ad accounts inside the business centers on a set cadence (once every 15 minutes for example). You'll also be looking at metrics to see which ones are worth topping up, and which ones are not. Attention to detail and financial responsibility very important here.  We require two of these positions per pod. Candidates with ACCOUNTING background preferred.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuick video explaining how the team will function together: \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, answer the following q's in a QUICK LOOM VIDEO. I need to see what you're like and looms are the best way of doing it. 60 second length is enough as long as you explain the q's below:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Which position are you interested in?\n\r\n2. 8 hours a day shifts, are you okay with that?\n\r\n3. Do you have a gaming PC? List the specs if yes.\n\r\n4. Do you have any prior experience running ads, being inside business centers or ads dashboards?\n\r\n5. Why are you looking for work right now?\n\r\n\n\r\nPS: After initial trial period, performance will be HEAVILY rewarded\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to scaling together!                ",

I'm looking for a sharp, organized virtual assistant to be my right hand on the operations side of things.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a typical VA role. **You'll essentially be my number two** -- helping me run things, not just checking off tasks. I need someone who takes ownership, builds systems, thinks strategically, and holds me accountable. If I'm dragging my feet on something, I expect you to follow up and push me to get it done. If you're someone who waits quietly for the next task, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n### What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Document & file organization** -- Organizing Google Drive, cloud storage, and local files. Building folder structures and naming conventions. Proactively thinking about ways to improve our efficiency and readiness for taxes and other document-heavy events -- not just organizing once, but creating systems that stay organized.\n\r\n- **Personal admin & gifting** -- Researching and ordering gifts for friends, family, and business contacts. Handling purchases and managing recurring personal tasks that keep falling through the cracks.\n\r\n- **Travel booking & points optimization** -- Booking travel, tracking my points balances across programs, and recommending the best way to use them for each trip. Proactively flagging deals and redemption opportunities.\n\r\n- **Calendar & scheduling** -- Coordinating meetings, blocking focus time, keeping me on track.\n\r\n- **Sales operations & client support** -- I handle the selling, but you help close the loop. Sending out DocuSigns, following up with clients, preparing contracts and consulting agreements, and handling the admin side of closing deals.\n\r\n- **Copywriting** -- Drafting copy for consulting proposals, client-facing\ns, social media posts, and other communications as needed.\n\r\n- **Product & market research** -- Researching competitors, market positioning, and user needs for new applications I'm building. You'll be my thought partner on this, not just a data gatherer.\n\r\n- **AI tools & marketing research** -- Staying on top of new AI tools and marketing strategies. Identifying what we should be using and how to implement them.\n\r\n- **Content summarization** -- Summarizing articles, reports, and content I haven't had time to read. We'll build an AI-assisted workflow for this together.\n\r\n\n\r\n### What Makes You Stand Out\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're a systematizer.** The first time you do something, you document it. You create SOPs, checklists, and templates so it never has to be figured out twice. You think in systems, not one-off tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're proactive and direct.** You don't wait to be told what to do next. You see what needs doing and you flag it. You're comfortable being frank with me -- if something is falling behind, you say so.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're organized and trustworthy.** You manage details without dropping balls. You handle sensitive information (finances, personal accounts) with discretion.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You can think independently.** When I give you a goal, you figure out the steps. You don't need every decision made for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Required Skills\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong English communication (written and verbal)\n\r\n- Google Workspace (Drive, Docs, Sheets, Calendar)\n\r\n- Notion (or similar project management/knowledge base tools)\n\r\n- Comfortable with video calls and async communication\n\r\n\n\r\n### Nice to Have\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) -- I'm happy to teach this if you're a fast learner\n\r\n- Ability to set up Slack integrations and automations\n\r\n- Experience with travel booking and points/miles optimization\n\r\n- Previous experience as a personal or executive assistant\n\r\n- Bookkeeping or basic financial organization experience\n\r\n\n\r\n### Schedule & Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Starting at 10 hours/week** with the opportunity to scale to full-time as we build trust and the workload grows\n\r\n- **$300/month retainer** to start\n\r\n- Flexible hours -- I care about output, not when you're online\n\r\n- Long-term role -- I'm looking for someone to grow with, not a short-term hire\n\r\n\n\r\n### How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A brief intro about yourself and your experience as a VA\n\r\n2. Tell me about a time you created a system or process that made your client's life easier\n\r\n3. What AI tools do you currently use, if any? (It's okay if the answer is none -- I value honesty over a padded resume)\n\r\n4. Your availability and preferred working hours\n\r\n\n\r\nI'll be doing a 30-minute video interview with shortlisted candidates, followed by a small paid test task so we can both see if the fit is right.

We manufacture in Canada, or source electronics overseas, then protect and position them properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have dominated brick and mortar retail for decades. Now we are building a serious digital revenue engine.

We're a mission-driven health technology company helping thousands of older Americans reduce chronic pain and avoid unnecessary medications. We're growing fast, and we need someone exceptionally detail-oriented to handle customer service and content tasks using AI tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur customers are older adults (50+) who are often skeptical, technically challenged, and need compassionate, clear communication. You'll be their main point of contact.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is 60% customer service, 40% content work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll actually be doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomer Service (Primary Focus - 60% of time):\n\r\n- Respond to 20-30 customer inquiries daily \n & chat) in our ticketing system\n\r\n- Use Claude AI to draft responses, then critically review and personalize them\n\r\n- Adapt our\n templates (makros) to each customer's specific situation\n\r\n- Read full conversation history before responding, context is everything\n\r\n- Handle returns, warranty cases, medical questions following our protocols\n\r\n- Know when to escalate vs. handle independently\n\r\n\n\r\nContent & Marketing (40% of time):\n\r\n- Write science-backed blog posts with AI assistance (you prompt, proofread, fact-check, optimize)\n\r\n- Create social media content with Canva (using our templates)\n\r\n- Schedule posts and engage with our audience\n\r\n- Reach out to health & wellness influencers for partnerships (80% automated already)\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical requirements (no exceptions):\n\r\n- 5+ years of customer service experience (preferably in health, wellness, or medical devices)\n\r\n- Near-native English (our customers are American seniors)\n\r\n- Proven experience using AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.). You should already be using AI in your current work\n\r\n- Experience with project management tools (ClickUp, Asana, Trello etc)\n\r\n- Obsessive attention to detail. You catch mistakes others miss\n\r\n- Fast learner who takes notes and doesn't repeat mistakes\n\r\n- Excellent internet connection and professional workspace\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll struggle in this role if you:\n\r\n- Copy-paste AI responses without critical thinking\n\r\n- Don't read full context before responding\n\r\n- Tend to make the same mistake over and over again\n\r\n- Need constant supervision\n\r\n- Work multiple jobs and can't focus\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat makes someone successful here:\n\r\n- Read full context before responding (you're thorough, not rushed)\n\r\n- Customize templates thoughtfully (not copy-paste)\n\r\n- Think critically about whether your responses make sense\n\r\n- Take pride in helping people solve real problems\n\r\n- Want to build something, not just clock hours\n\r\n- See feedback as a gift, not criticism\n\r\n- You work independently but know when to ask for help\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat makes this opportunity different:\n\r\n- Career growth path: We're hiring for a Customer Service Specialist today, but we're building toward a Customer Service Team Lead role. As we scale, the right person will lead our support team, train new hires, and shape our customer experience strategy. \n\r\n- Competitive compensation: $1,000 - $1,200/month USD for full-time (40 hours/week) with true growth potential.\n\r\n- Paid time off: 15 days paid annual leave (includes public holidays, you choose when to take them).\n\r\n- Professional development: Access to courses, AI tools, and direct mentorship from our founder. We invest in people who invest in themselves.\n\r\n- Flexible schedule (must overlap at least 3 hours with Thailand time)\n\r\n- Process-driven company with comprehensive training with documentation, videos, and daily feedback\n\r\n- Cutting-edge tools: You'll work with the latest AI technology. This isn't data entry, you're learning skills that will be valuable for years to come.\n\r\n- Meaningful work: Our customers are grandparents who want to play with their grandkids without pain, veterans managing injuries, people avoiding opioids. Your work directly improves lives.\n\r\n- Stability with a startup: We're profitable, growing steadily, and been in business for 3 years. You get startup opportunity without the risk.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur hiring process:\n\r\n1) Video application (3-5 min) - see questions below\n\r\n2) Video interview (30 min) - we'll get to know you, answer your questions & test your thinking\n\r\n3) Paid trial task (4 hours, $50) - customer service scenarios to filter for skills. Tests attention to detail, AI usage, customer service judgment\n\r\n4) Trial week (20 hours, $160) - Work with real tickets. We will filter for learning ability & work ethic.\n\r\n5) Probation month ($1,000) - for both of us to understand whether we're a good fit\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a high bar. We've had candidates with 10+ years of experience not work out because they lacked attention to detail and didn't learn from mistakes. If you're not someone who naturally catches details and learns quickly, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, create a video (Use Loom, Dubb or similar tools) answering these questions:\n\r\n1) Customer service experience: Tell me about your experience (years, industry etc) and mention one of the most challenging tickets you worked on and how you resolved it.\n\r\n2) AI usage: How do you currently use AI in your work? Be specific with tools and tasks\n\r\n3) Why you: Let us know why you think we should choose you over other candidates\n\r\n\n\r\nYour video should be max 5 minutes. Applications without video will be automatically rejected.                ",

The editing energy leans closer to a perfectly-timed After Effects edit / storytelling than a corporate product video. (You have an eye for aesthetics and cinematography)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will receive a script, a voiceover file, and a mood reference. Your job is to build the scene from nothing: generate AI visuals, voiceovers, source archival footage, layer sound design, and deliver a short where every second earns the next. A visual storyteller. (We provide access to the frontier generation models)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Style\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Dark luxury. Museum. AE VFX edit. Stylish/Lethal. Fun. Rich textures. Clean typography. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut default presets. Anything that looks like a stock photo slideshow or a corporate deck.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that more effects does not necessarily mean better. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Skills (Non-Negotiables)\n\r\n\n\r\nMotion Graphics - You can build scenes, transitions, and visual elements from scratch in After Effects - not just cut footage.\n\r\n\n\r\nVoiceover-First Storytelling - You are editing to a narration primarily, music track second. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate. You never bury the script's punchline under a flashy transition. The voice leads - the visuals serve.\n\r\n\n\r\nRetention Instinct - You understand that the first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually, not just with text overlays. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nRhythm & Beat-Sync - You can sync cuts, zooms, and effects to music. You understand \"the drop.\" If you've made AMVs, fan/anime edits, or phonk edits, you already have this skill - we want you to apply it with restraint.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-Assisted Asset Creation - You are comfortable generating images and short clips using tools like Midjourney or Kling. (We usually move onto new tools as soon as they are released). You treat AI as a production tool, not a novelty. We provide all paid accounts - you bring the creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Skills (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- After Effects compositing - Mocha tracking, light matching (future projects will involve product placement in video scenes)\n\r\n- Typography sense - fonts that feel intentional, never default\n\r\n- Color grading - pushing AI output and footage into a consistent palette\n\r\n- Sound design beyond music - layering SFX on movement, crafting risers and hits\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Output\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 2–3 shorts as you learn the brand voice and pipeline.\n\r\nSteady state: 4–5 shorts per week at the locked quality standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work from clear creative briefs with reference scripts, mood boards, and audio clips for most batches.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: Lethal Editor - [Your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Story Test. Link to ONE short-form video you edited that includes voiceover or spoken dialogue. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The AE Style Test. Link to ONE video that shows your visual rhythm and editing craft - an AMV, fan edit, fashion reel, or anything where the editing itself is the skill. It doesn't need to be \"dark\" or \"luxury.\" It needs to show us how you think about pacing and impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. AI Experience (1 sentence). What is your experience level with generative AI tools (Midjourney, seedream, Kling, etc.)? If none, say so - we'll evaluate the rest of your application on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Turnaround Estimate. How long does a 30–50 second high-quality short typically take you, start to finish?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and modern: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Trial (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real scripts and style references. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week (after work). If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to $550 USD payments every 2 weeks (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both of us - you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools; seedance2.0, seedream5.0, etc.\n\r\n- Creative identity - you're building the visual identity of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\n- Clear briefs - most, if not every batch comes with scripts, audio files, mood boards, and specific reference videos\n\r\n- Direct feedback - specific, constructive notes on every edit.\n\r\n- A brand worth building - Prismiera launches April 2026. A second AI native game/anime brand after that. You're not joining a machine. You're helping build one.                ",
