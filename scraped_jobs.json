    "description": "\n                    We are a growing e-commerce drop shipping brand looking to automate our customer service operations using AI. Currently, we utilize Re:amaze (unintegrated), but we are at a crossroads. We need a specialist who can audit our current setup and provide a high-level recommendation: Do we optimize and integrate our current tool, or migrate to a more robust AI-native platform like Gorgias or Intercom?\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce the tech stack is finalized, you will be responsible for the full technical implementation, ensuring our support system can resolve 60%+ of tickets autonomously.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPHASE 1: Audit & Strategy (Immediate Priority)\n\r\nTech Stack Audit: Evaluate our Shopify backend and current Re:amaze setup.\n\r\nRecommendation Report: Present the most cost-effective and scalable path (Fix Re:amaze vs. Migrate to a new CRM).\n\r\nWorkflow Mapping: Identify the top 5 high-volume manual tasks (WISMO, returns, cancellations) and map out how AI will handle them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPHASE 2: Implementation & Training\n\r\nDeep Integration: Connect Shopify, shipping trackers (e.g., 17Track), and the chosen CRM to ensure the AI has real-time data access.\n\r\nAI Training: Work with our Back-End Manager to feed our FAQs, SOPs, and brand voice into the AI Knowledge Base.\n\r\nAction-Based Automation: Build logic-based flows that allow the AI to do work (e.g., process a refund if conditions are met), not just suggest text.\n\r\nQuality Assurance: Set up a \"Human-in-the-loop\" testing phase to ensure 90%+ accuracy before going fully live.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\r\nE-commerce AI Expertise: Proven track record of setting up AI automation for Shopify stores (ideally drop shipping).\n\r\nTool Agnostic: Expertise in multiple platforms (Gorgias, Zendesk, Intercom, or Re:amaze) to provide an unbiased recommendation.\n\r\nTechnical Logic: Experience with API integrations, Liquid variables, and automation tools like \n or Zapier.\n\r\nLanguage & Tone: Ability to prompt-engineer the AI to sound empathetic, professional, and human.\n\r\nResults-Driven: Must be able to demonstrate how your previous builds reduced \"First Response Time\" and \"Resolution Time.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nTo ensure your application is reviewed, please answer the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. We are currently using Re:amaze without Shopify integration. In your experience, what are the top 3 technical limitations of Re:amaze compared to Gorgias or Zendesk when it comes to automated refund processing?\n\r\n2. Can you share a specific example of an e-commerce automation you built that reduced human ticket volume by at least 30%? What tools did you use?\n\r\n3. How would you set up a workflow to handle a 'Where is my order?' request where the tracking hasn't moved for 7 days? Walk us through the 'If/Then' logic you would use.\n\r\n4. On a scale of 1-10, how comfortable are you with using \n, Zapier, or APIs to connect Shopify data to a CRM? (Provide one example of a custom connection you've made).\n\r\n5. Based on our goal of migrating/optimizing and automating 50% of tickets, how many weeks do you typically need from 'Audit' to 'Live Launch'?                ",

This is business evaluation.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional Projects (Growth Opportunity)\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond the farm, I am exploring:\n\r\n\n\r\nCreating structured focus group research systems for U.S. companies seeking insight into the emerging middle class in Southeast Asia (especially the Philippines)\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring and coordinating with an AI software developer for future initiatives\n\r\n\n\r\nBuilding repeatable systems for evaluating small-scale ventures\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, this role may expand into light operations coordination, project structuring, and cross-border collaboration.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nVisit the Surigao farm (likely weekly at first) to observe operations\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild simple but accurate financial tracking systems\n\r\n\n\r\nConduct cost and margin analysis\n\r\n\n\r\nProvide honest assessments (even if the answer is “stop this project”)\n\r\n\n\r\nHelp structure new business experiments\n\r\n\n\r\nAssist in organizing project workflows (experience with ClickUp or similar tools is a plus)\n\r\n\n\r\nWork independently and report findings clearly\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is Ideal For\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is ideal for someone who:\n\r\n\n\r\nHas a degree in Accounting, Finance, Economics, or Business\n\r\n\n\r\nHas strong analytical thinking skills\n\r\n\n\r\nIs comfortable making recommendations — not just reporting numbers\n\r\n\n\r\nHas strong communication and people skills\n\r\n\n\r\nWants exposure to international and technology-related projects\n\r\n\n\r\nIs interested in growing into a broader business operations role\n\r\n\n\r\nCPA license is welcome but not required.\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation\n\r\n\n\r\nSurigao City preferred.\n\r\nNearby applicants who can travel for regular site visits may apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn-site presence is important — this cannot be fully remote.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a part-time role (8–10 hours per week to start).\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation will be based on experience and capability. As these are early-stage ventures, the budget reflects a growing operation rather than a large corporation.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include your expected hourly rate in your application.\n\r\n\n\r\nCandidates who are primarily seeking high corporate compensation may not find this role suitable. Candidates who are interested in responsibility, autonomy, and long-term growth will be strongly considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease send:\n\r\n\n\r\nYour resume\n\r\n\n\r\nYour location\n\r\n\n\r\nYour expected hourly rate\n\r\n\n\r\nA short paragraph explaining why this type of early-stage role interests you\n\r\n\n\r\n: \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are analytical, practical, and interested in helping build real ventures from the ground up, I would be glad to speak with you.

    "description": "\n                    \n Developer – OpenClaw / Claude Code Agentic Systems (Remote - Fulltime)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompany: \n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are\n\r\nAt GMU.online, we don't just build software; we engineer autonomous systems. We are a technology company that builds scalable, managed SaaS solutions for e-commerce, driven by proprietary AI and automation. Our mission is to replace manual workflows with intelligent, self-executing agentic processes. We are running our business with a long-term, elite Agentic Dev Team to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI-driven development and operations.\n\r\n\n\r\n The Role: Architect of Autonomous Agents\n\r\nWe are looking for a \n Developer with a rare and proven specialization: building and deploying production-level OpenClaw agents. This is not a traditional development role. You will not be writing routine CRUD applications. Instead, you will design, train, and deploy autonomous agentic workflows that handle complex, multi-step processes—from data analysis and code generation to fully automated outreach and system optimization—without human intervention.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work at the frontier of software development, \n backends with the decision-making power of large language models (LLMs) to create software that actively works for us.\n\r\n\n\r\n Your Core Mission: Agentic Process Automation (APA)\n\r\nYou have deep experience with the OpenClaw & Claude Code ecosystem. You understand that an agent is more than a script; it is a goal-oriented, self-correcting system. You will be responsible for:\n\r\n\n\r\nArchitecting and deploying autonomous agents that execute complex, multi-day workflows (similar to complex cold outreach sequences, data enrichment pipelines, or automated code refactoring tasks).\n\r\n\n\r\nDesigning the Orgestrator \"agent brain\", the prompts, decision trees, and tool definitions that allow Claude Code to interact with \n backend, APIs, and external services.\n\r\n\n\r\nBuilding the feedback loops and memory systems that enable agents to learn from successes and failures, improving over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n Technical Requirements: Non-Negotiable Expertise\n\r\nThis role requires a specific and rare combination of deep traditional development skills and bleeding-edge AI agent experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. \n Engineering (8+ Years)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n (8+ years): Expert-level proficiency in C#, .NET 6/8+, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core. You understand the runtime, memory management, and asynchronous programming patterns intimately.\n\r\n\n\r\nSystem Architecture: Proven ability to design scalable, resilient, and maintainable backend systems, often involving complex integrations with databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL), message queues, and RESTful APIs.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. OpenClaw / Claude Code Agentic Development (1+ Years)\n\r\n\n\r\nMandatory Proven Experience: This is the core of the role. You must have a minimum of 1.5 years of hands-on experience building and deploying production-level agents using the OpenClaw & Claude Code.\n\r\n\n\r\nAgentic Workflow Design: You can demonstrate experience designing fully automated, agentic processes that run for extended periods (hours or days) and involve multiple steps, conditional logic, and external tool use. This includes managing the agent's context window, state, and error handling.\n\r\n\n\r\nLLM Integration: Deep understanding of how to effectively prompt and constrain Claude (or similar LLMs) to reliably execute tasks, call functions (tool use), and parse structured output for integration \n systems.\n\r\n\n\r\n What You Must Demonstrate\n\r\nWe will select candidates based on demonstrable, verifiable experience. In your video interview, you must be prepared to show, not just tell.\n\r\n\n\r\nLive Project Walkthrough: You will be asked to share your screen and walk us through multiple complex, autonomous OpenClaw agent projects you have built and deployed independently.\n\r\n\n\r\nCode & Architecture Review: We will want to see the architecture of your agents—how you structured the prompts, the tools you gave them, and how they interact with backend services.\n\r\n\n\r\nResults & Outcomes: Show us the output. What did your agents achieve? Was it automated code generation, a full-scale outreach campaign, data processing, or system maintenance? What were the success metrics?\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Technical Toolkit\n\r\nLanguages & Frameworks: C#, .NET (6/8+), ASP.NET Core.\n\r\n\n\r\nAgentic AI: OpenClaw, Claude Code (Anthropic API) , prompt engineering, tool use/function calling, context window management.\n\r\n\n\r\nDatabases & Messaging: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Entity Framework Core, RabbitMQ/Kafka (or similar).\n\r\n\n\r\nDevOps & Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps), cloud platforms (Azure/AWS).\n\r\n\n\r\nAPIs & Integrations: RESTful design, experience integrating with various third-party APIs (e.g.,\n, CRM, data enrichment services) to give your agents tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Sets You Apart (The Elite Factor)\n\r\nPublished Work: You have live & running Openclaw agentic systems that you can show.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdvanced Agent Patterns: Experience with multi-agent systems (where agents collaborate), or agents with long-ter\nmory/vector database integration.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Optimization: You understand the cost/performance trade-offs of LLM calls and optimize agent workflows for both speed and token efficiency.\n\r\n\n\r\n Why Join GMU.online?\n\r\nBuild the Future, Not Legacy Code: Work on the absolute cutting edge of software development—autonomous AI agents.\n\r\n\n\r\nElite Team: You will be surrounded by and collaborate with other top-tier developers who are also pushing the boundaries of AI and automation.\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term Vision: This is a long-term role in a dedicated Agentic Dev Team, not a short-term project. You will have the stability and support to build ambitious, complex systems over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nFull Ownership & Autonomy: High trust and high freedom. You own your agents from conception to deployment and monitoring.\n\r\n\n\r\nGlobal Collaboration: Work remotely with a team of international experts who value async communication, clear ownership, and groundbreaking results over micromanagement.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to build the software that builds itself? If you have the proven track record, apply now and be prepared to show us your agents in action.                ",

We need a video editor who can produce direct response ads for\n and Instagram.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT a corporate video editing job. You will be editing short-form (30–90 second) ads designed to sell products. If you have experience editing e-commerce ads, product demo videos, or direct response marketing content, you are exactly who we are looking for.\n\r\n\n\r\n? READ THIS BEFORE YOU APPLY:\n\r\nWe have extremely high expectations. This job is not for everyone. You will carry heavy responsibility – the ads you produce directly determine how fast this brand grows. You will be judged on output and results, not hours logged. You must think independently, solve problems without hand-holding, and take full ownership of your work. If you need micromanagement, do not apply.\n\r\nThat said – if you are a high performer, you will be rewarded like one. We operate a generous performance bonus system where your pay increases based on how well your ads perform. Top editors on this team will earn significantly more than the base rate. We want people who are hungry, take pride in their craft, and want to grow with a brand that is scaling fast.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU WILL DO:\n\r\n• Edit 30–90 second direct response video ads for Meta \n/Instagram)\n\r\n• Work from creative briefs provided by the founder – you will always know exactly what to produce\n\r\n• Match visuals to voiceover audio precisely – what the viewer sees must match what they hear\n\r\n• Use AI video/image generation tools (Sora, VEO, Higgs Field, etc.) to create B-roll footage when needed\n\r\n• Deliver polished, scroll-stopping ads with clean pacing, text overlays, and transitions\n\r\n• Hit deadlines – we move fast and need consistent output\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\r\n• Previous experience editing e-commerce or direct response ads (send portfolio/examples)\n\r\n• Strong understanding of pacing, hooks, and what makes someone stop scrolling\n\r\n• Good English communication – you need to understand briefs and ask questions when unclear\n\r\n• Reliable internet and your own editing setup (Premiere Pro, After Effects, CapCut, DaVinci – any professional tool)\n\r\n• Willingness to learn and take feedback – we will train you on our specific style\n\r\n• Available minimum 4–6 hours per day\n\r\n\n\r\nNICE TO HAVE (NOT REQUIRED):\n\r\n• Experience with AI video generation tools (Sora, VEO 3, Higgs Field, Kling, etc.)\n\r\n• Experience in the pet niche or health/wellness D2C brands\n\r\n• Understanding of\n ad creative strategy (hooks, CTAs, UGC-style editing)\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION:\n\r\nBase pay: $800–$1,200/month USD depending on experience. We run a performance bonus system tied directly to ad results. When your ads generate strong ROAS and scale, you earn bonuses on top of your base. This is not a token gesture. Editors who consistently produce winning ads will earn significantly above the base rate. We want people who are motivated by results and want their income to grow as the brand grows.\n\r\n\n\r\nPREFERRED WORKING HOURS:\n\r\n12:00 PM – 12:00 AM Manila time (PHT). You do not need to work this entire block, but your active hours should fall within this range for communication overlap.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY:\n\r\nDo NOT just send your resume. To be considered, you MUST submit a short Loom video (2–4 minutes) covering the following:\n\r\n1. Your name and a brief introduction\n\r\n2. Your previous editing experience – specifically any e-commerce or ad work\n\r\n3. What editing tools you use\n\r\n4. Your experience with AI tools (if any)\n\r\n5. Your strengths and weaknesses as an editor\n\r\n6. How many hours per day and per week you are available\n\r\n7. Your expected monthly pay in USD\n\r\nAlso include a link to your portfolio or 2–3 examples of ads you have edited.\n\r\nInclude your WhatsApp number in your application. If selected, we will contact you directly via WhatsApp.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without a Loom video will NOT be reviewed.                ",

IMPORTANT Please read below before submitting your application.\n\r\nIn the application form, you'll be required to submit a 2-minute video introduction answering: Who are you, and why do you think you're the best fit for this role?\n\r\nYou'll also be asked a few short written questions. If your video checks out, we'll invite you to interview.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role exists because the CEO is doing too many things that aren't CEO-level work. Inbox management, recruitment coordination, content scheduling, lead magnet setup — it's all getting done, but it's eating into time that should be spent on strategy and growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone sharp, process-driven, and reliable to take ownership of the operational and marketing coordination tasks that keep the agency running smoothly behind the scenes.\n\r\nThis isn't a passive \"wait for instructions\" role. You'll follow clear systems and SOPs, but we need someone who can take a process, run with it, and flag when something's off — not someone who needs to be chased.\n\r\n— Andy Gray, Founder & CEO\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are\n\r\nThe Graygency is a performance marketing agency working with 7–8 figure DTC e-commerce brands across the UK, US, and UAE. We call ourselves Performance Scientists — we're in the P&L, not just the ad account. We're building an agency powered by systems, AI, and commercial thinking, not headcount.\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n\n\r\nRecruitment Coordination\n\r\nRun LinkedIn headhunting campaigns following our recruiting playbook, sourcing, messaging, and screening candidates\n\r\nSend 60–80 outreach messages per day during active hiring periods\n\r\nScreen video applications and flag strong candidates for interview\n\r\nManage the recruitment pipeline end to end, from first message to interview scheduling\n\r\nPost and manage job listings on platforms like OnlineJobs.ph and LinkedIn\n\r\n\n\r\n???? In your application, use the Code: 8000 applications without this subject line will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nMarketing Coordination\n\r\nSchedule and publish content across LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok\n\r\nSet up YouTube videos - titles, descriptions, shorts, and reels from existing long-form content\n\r\nCoordinate between the content creator, designers, and copywriters to keep the content engine moving\n\r\nSet up and send newsletters\n\r\nBuild and distribute lead magnets (taking existing content and packaging it)\n\r\nSet up automations for content distribution (e.g. ManyChat comment-to-DM flows)\n\r\n\n\r\nExecutive Support\n\r\nManage the CEO's diary and inbox - prioritise, flag, and respond where appropriate\n\r\nSchedule calls, meetings, and podcast guest appearances\n\r\nReconcile Accounts\n\r\nKeep task lists and follow-ups organised in ClickUp\n\r\nHandle ad hoc operational tasks that free up leadership time\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\nThe CEO spends two hours a week or less on marketing coordination and admin. Recruitment pipelines are full without the CEO lifting a finger. Content goes out consistently. \n\r\n\n\r\nNothing falls through the cracks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Skills We Need You To Bring\n\r\n2+ years experience as a VA, executive assistant, or marketing coordinator (agency experience a plus)\n\r\nProven experience with LinkedIn outreach or recruitment coordination\n\r\nComfortable scheduling and posting across social platforms (LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)\n\r\nStrong written English — you'll be sending messages on behalf of the CEO\n\r\nHighly organised and process-driven you follow SOPs precisely and flag issues early\n\r\nExperience with tools like ClickUp, Slack, Google Workspace, and Canva\n\r\nAbility to work UK/European time zone hours (non-negotiable)\n\r\nExcellent attention to detail — if instructions say do X, you do X\n\r\n\n\r\nNice-to-Haves\n\r\nExperience with ManyChat or similar automation tools\n\r\nFamiliarity with newsletter platforms (Beehiiv, Mailchimp, etc.)\n\r\nExperience working with DTC e-commerce brands or performance marketing agencies\n\r\nBasic understanding of content repurposing workflows\n\r\nExperience with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for drafting and coordination\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\nCompetitive monthly salary (based on experience)\n\r\nPaid public holidays and leave entitlements\n\r\nDirect access to the CEO — you're not buried in a team, you're at the centre of operations\n\r\nClear growth pathway — this role can evolve into a full marketing coordinator position as the agency scales\n\r\nA fast-moving, innovative team that's building something different\n\r\n\n\r\nRed Flags (Don't Apply If…)\n\r\nYou need to be told what to do every step of the way\n\r\nYou can't follow written instructions precisely\n\r\nYou disappear when things get busy\n\r\nYour English isn't strong enough to send professional outreach on behalf of a CEO\n\r\nYou're applying to 50 jobs at once and hoping one sticks\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Culture\n\r\nWe believe in doing things well at The Graygency — we are constantly looking for ways to innovate and improve the delivery of our product.

    "description": "\n                    [Caution]\n\r\nIf you are a meticulous developer who is passionate about building robust, scalable web applications and takes pride in writing clean, efficient code for both the front-end and back-end, this role will be a great fit.\n\r\nThis position requires a deep understanding of the entire development lifecycle, from database design and API architecture to creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces.\n\r\nIf you view development as simply connecting pre-built components or relying heavily on AI without a deep consideration for security, performance, and the end-user experience, this role may be a challenge for you.\n\r\nSo, only read further if you’re passionate about building the entire foundation for a thriving online community from the ground up (ideally with a self-assessed programming ability level of 4.5 out of 5 stars or higher).\n\r\n\n\r\n[Job Title]\n\r\nFull-Stack Developer (Community Platform)\n\r\n\n\r\n[Work Type]\n\r\nRemote | Flexible Hours | Long-term Project\n\r\n\n\r\n[Base Payment]\n\r\nWe offer a project-based compensation structure for those who apply as part-time. That said, the expected monthly range is USD $700–$1,400(for full-time workers), depending on factors such as proficiency, workload, task complexity, performance (including bonuses), experience, skill set, and the final scope of responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Bonus]\n\r\nThere's potential for a performance-based bonus tied to key project milestones, such as a successful platform launch and achieving performance metrics. We'll go over those details once you've demonstrated your skills.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What You’ll Be Doing]\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to be the technical architect and builder of our community website. You will be responsible for creating a high-quality, full-featured platform that provides a seamless and engaging experience for our users. \n\r\nYour main tasks will include ONE or MULTIPLE of:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Full-Stack Platform Architecture & Development: You will design and build the entire community website from the ground up, creating a scalable database schema (e.g., with PostgreSQL/MongoDB) and developing a responsive front-end architecture using a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue).\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Community Feature Implementation: You will develop the core features that bring our community to life, including dynamic user profiles, personalized content feeds, and the systems for creating, sharing, and commenting on posts.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) User & Admin Communication Systems: You will build a secure, real-time messaging interface for users to contact our support team and integrate third-party\n services (e.g., SendGrid) for automated notifications and contact form submissions.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Security & User Authentication: You will implement a robust user authentication system with secure login/registration flows, password hashing, and session management. You'll apply security best practices throughout the stack to protect against common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection).\n\r\n\n\r\ne) End-to-End Testing & Quality Assurance: You will be responsible for the entire testing process, from writing unit and integration tests to debugging issues across the full stack to ensure a stable and bug-free user experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Deployment & Maintenance: You will manage the deployment pipeline (CI/CD) to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Vercel), monitor application performance, and perform ongoing maintenance to keep the platform fast and reliable as it grows.\n\r\n\n\r\n[A Typical Week May Look Like This]\n\r\n\n\r\nDuring Development: Architecting database models. Building out REST API endpoints. Writing clean, scalable code for new front-end and back-end features. Debugging and testing functionality across various browsers. Committing code to our Git repository.\n\r\n\n\r\nPost-Launch: Monitoring server performance and error logs. Planning and developing new features based on community feedback. Optimizing database queries and code to improve speed and efficiency.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Goal]\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to create a fast, secure, and intuitive web platform that serves as the central hub for our online community. By building a high-quality website, you will empower our members to connect, share, and engage in a meaningful way, making our community an essential part of their online experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n[What We’re Looking For]\n\r\nThe ideal candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Has a Strong Portfolio: You have verifiable experience building and launching full-stack web applications. You can show us live examples of projects you have built.\n\r\n\n\r\nb) Is Technically Proficient: You are an expert in your chosen full-stack technologies (e.g., MERN, LAMP, Django/Python, Ruby on Rails) and have deep experience designing and consuming REST APIs. You follow best practices and write clean, maintainable code.\n\r\n\n\r\nc) Is a Natural Problem-Solver: When faced with a technical challenge like a slow database query or a complex front-end state issue, you have a logical process for diagnosing the root cause and implementing an effective solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nd) Is a Clear & Proactive Communicator: You can explain complex technical concepts simply to non-technical tea\nmbers.\n\r\n\n\r\ne) Is Product-Minded: You care about the end-user experience. You think critically about features and can offer valuable insights to help make the product better from both a technical and user perspective.\n\r\n\n\r\nf) Communicates Effectively and Values Respect: You are reliable, accountable, and understand the importance of clear communication within a remote team.\n\r\n\n\r\n*Important Note:\n\r\nWe value respectful communication. What does it mean? Most importantly, if you need to step away, just let me or your manager know when. We understand it, even if you need to leave tomorrow, BUT ghosting is the last thing you'd like to do, since it causes confusion and delays. In everyday conversations, our team thrives on mutual respect, no matter your role.\n\r\n\n\r\n[Why Work With Us?]\n\r\n\n\r\n-Flexible hours to suit your lifestyle.\n\r\n-The opportunity to own a project and build an exciting product from the ground up.\n\r\n-Long-term growth opportunities as our community and platform scale.\n\r\n-A supportive environment where your technical expertise is valued and your impact is visible.\n\r\n\n\r\n[About Us]\n\r\nWe are building a vibrant online community for content creators. Our mission is to provide a space where members can connect, learn, and grow. Your role in building our web platform is the critical foundation for that mission.\n\r\n\n\r\n[How to Apply]\n\r\nSubject Line: Start your title with “Full-Stack Developer”, or your application can't be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Please indicate which items (a–f) from the [What You’ll Be Doing] section above you can handle professionally and confidently.\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Work History: Based on your response to Question 1, please describe your experience for each item (a–f).\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Portfolio: Include direct links to your two best live web applications you’ve built. Briefly describe your specific role and the tech stack used in those two projects.\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Technical Challenge: Imagine our users are reporting that the website's main content feed is slow to load and feels \"laggy\" when they scroll. What are the first five steps you would take to diagnose and fix this performance issue, considering both the front-end and back-end?\n\r\n\n\r\n5) Architectural Scenario: You are tasked with building the user-to-admin private messaging feature. Briefly describe the high-level architecture you would choose to ensure messages are delivered in real-time and that the system is both reliable and secure. Mention key front-end, back-end, and database considerations.\n\r\n\n\r\n6) Describe the most challenging or poorly-documented piece of legacy code you were tasked with modifying. What made it so difficult to understand? Walk me through your methodical process for safely making your required change without breaking anything.\n\r\n\n\r\n7) Preferred Tool Stack: What are your go-to languages, frameworks, databases, and tools for full-stack web development? Please mention why you prefer them.\n\r\n\n\r\n8) AI in Your Workflow: Although AI-generated code can save time, it may include subtle bugs or security issues that less experienced developers might miss. Explain where and how you use AI to improve your development productivity, and where you deliberately choose not to rely on AI. (We expect you aren't using AI to answer these questions, as they will be discussed in the interview.)\n\r\n\n\r\n9) Available Hours: Let us know your general availability (e.g., \"Approximately 20 hours per week, mostly flexible between 1PM - 8PM on Monday, 3 PM - 10PM on Tuesday, 12PM - 8PM on Wednesday, ..., in Philippines time\").\n\r\n\n\r\n10) Available Period of Work: Let us know for how long you expect to work with this job. We'd prefer a long-term collaboration.\n\r\n\n\r\n11) Willingness for Zoo\netings: Confirm that you're willing to participate in occasional Zoo\netings for team alignment and check-ins.\n\r\n\n\r\nI will respond to your application in 7-15 days all at once.\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.

    "description": "\n                    Graphic Designer – Social Media & Presentations\n\r\nRemote | Australian Creative Agency | Philippines Preferred\n\r\nFull-time for the right person, however we will also consider ongoing freelance arrangements with an ongoing retainer/agreed work per month.\n\r\n\n\r\nAPPLICATION FORM: \n\r\n\n\r\nHey there!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a creative agency that helps businesses tell their stories through photography, videography, social media, and Meta advertising. We've been around since 2017 and currently manage growing retainer client base across B2B and service-based industries.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for a Graphic Designer to join our team and take ownership of our visual design output — both the social media content we create for clients and the internal materials that represent our own brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nBeing able to adapt/enhance a client's existing brand is also important. Some clients come to us with excellent brand playbooks and assets, others have a font and a logo and then it's up to us to get creative with it. So someone who who can develop the brand is important too.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who takes real pride in clean, polished design work, can manage multiple brands without mixing them up, and can make a pitch deck look like it belongs in a boardroom — keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Be Doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nClient Social Media Design (the majority of your time):\n\r\n\n\r\n- Designing carousels, static posts, video thumbnails, and story assets for our retainer clients across Instagram,\n, and LinkedIn\n\r\n- Working within established brand guidelines for each client — you'll manage multiple brand identities simultaneously\n\r\n- Receiving briefs through ClickUp and delivering designs for internal review before they go to the client\n\r\n- Maintaining visual consistency across each client's content so their feed looks intentional, not random\n\r\n\n\r\nInternal & Agency Design:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Updating and designing our pitch decks and proposals — these are what we use to win new clients, so they need to look sharp\n\r\n- Creating and formatting strategy presentations and content plans for client delivery\n\r\n- Designing internal templates, one-pagers, capability statements, and other brand collateral\n\r\n- Producing social media content for Narrative Hub's own channels\n\r\n- Refining the visual format of our monthly client reports\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tools You'll Work With:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Canva (Pro): Our preferred tool for day-to-day social media designs. Many clients have existing Canva templates that you'll build on and maintain. We're flexible on tools as long as the quality is there and revisions can be turned around quickly.\n\r\n- Adobe Creative Suite: Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign for more complex work — pitch decks, detailed presentations, advanced graphics, and anything that needs precision layout. We need you to be genuinely proficient here, not just familiar.\n\r\n- ClickUp: Where all briefs, feedback, time tracking, and task management lives. This is our central hub.\n\r\n- Dropbox: File storage and sharing for all working files and final deliverables.\n\r\n- PowerPoint / Google Slides: For presentation design and formatting as needed.\n\r\n- We provide all software subscriptions (Adobe, Canva Pro, etc.), Dropbox storage, and ClickUp access. You provide your own hardware and a reliable internet connection.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-haves:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 3+ years of professional graphic design experience, ideally in an agency or managing multiple brand accounts\n\r\n- Strong portfolio showing social media design work — carousels, static posts, branded content\n\r\n- Experience designing presentations and pitch decks to a high standard\n\r\n- Proficient in both Canva and Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign)\n\r\n- Solid understanding of typography, layout, visual hierarchy, and brand application\n\r\n- Detail-oriented — you notice when spacing is off, a colour is wrong, or a font doesn't match\n\r\n- Clear written communication in English\n\r\n- Comfortable with feedback and revisions — it's part of the process, not a personal critique\n\r\n\n\r\nGood to have:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience working with Australian businesses or in a similar time zone\n\r\n- Familiarity with social media platform specs and best practices (image sizes, safe zones, etc.)\n\r\n- Experience with B2B or service-based brands specifically\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Won't Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nJust to set expectations:\n\r\n\n\r\n- No video editing (we have dedicated editors for that)\n\r\n- No social media scheduling or community management\n\r\n- No photography or videography\n\r\n- No website design or development\n\r\n- No Meta ad campaign management\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won't be expected to write copy, but you may need to take our briefs and alter them to suit the designs. If you are very capable at copywriting, we will be happy for you to assist with writing copy for these posts as well, however it won't be necessary.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Work\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll have a dual reporting structure:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Social Media Manager/Coordinator: manages your day-to-day client work — they'll brief you, review your designs, and keep you aligned with content calendars\n\r\n- Managing Director: will brief you directly on all internal work — pitch decks, proposals, strategy presentations, and internal branding.\n\r\n- The Social Media Coordinator will also work closely with you on content calendar alignment and design briefs.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur process is straightforward:\n\r\n\n\r\n- You receive a brief in ClickUp with all the details — client, content type, messaging, brand assets\n\r\n- You design, tracking your time in ClickUp as you go\n\r\n- Internal review (1 round) — Social Media Manager or Coordinator for client work, MD for internal work.\n\r\n- Client approval (1 round) — managed by the Social Media Manager\n\r\n- Final files exported and saved to Dropbox, ready for scheduling\n\r\n- If a brief is unclear, we expect you to ask before you start — not after you've completed a draft.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Details\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation: Remote — Philippines-based candidates preferred\n\r\nEmployment Type: To be confirmed (may be full-time via EOR or contract)\n\r\nHours: Minimum 6–8 hours overlap with Brisbane business hours (9am–5pm AEST)\n\r\nCommunication: ClickUp for tasks and feedback, ClickUp Chat for quick questions and check-ins\n\r\nStart Date: TBC\n\r\n\n\r\nInterested?\n\r\n\n\r\n- If this sounds like a good fit, we'd love to hear from you. In your application, please share fill out the below form so we can assess your application:\n\r\n\n\r\nAPPLICATION FORM: \n\r\n\n\r\nPlease be sure to include in the form:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A link to your portfolio (or a few examples of your best social media design and presentation work)\n\r\n- A brief overview of your experience — especially if you've worked in an agency or managed multiple brands\n\r\n- Which tools you're most comfortable in (Canva, Adobe Suite, or both) and how you typically approach a design brief\n\r\n- Any other information it asks for\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you and we wish you the best with your application!\n\r\n                ",

If we’re a good fit, this can become steady, long-term work.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nThe Most Important Skill (Please Read)\n\r\nOur #1 rule:\n\r\nIf the thumbnail doesn’t read in one second at small mobile size, while people are scrolling on their phones, it doesn’t work.\n\r\nWe design for the phone screen first, not the desktop screen.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat means:\n\r\n• Clear visual story\n\r\n• Strong focal point\n\r\n• Minimal clutter\n\r\n• Expressions and emotion that are easy to read\n\r\n• Clean backgrounds or simplified compositions when needed\n\r\n\n\r\nMany frames from videos are busy or cluttered, so part of the job is knowing how to simplify, isolate, and clarify the story visually.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this is something you’re already good at, you’ll do very well with us.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nHow This Role Works\n\r\n\n\r\nWe provide a shared folder with the materials you need to create your video thumbnail. Depending on the type of video/thumbnail it can include things like:\n\r\n• The video title/video\n\r\n• Thumbnail direction/brief/concept/idea\n\r\n• Sample thumbnails that match our channel style and tone\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is to design a thumbnail that matches the overall look, feel, and strategy of the channel—while still using your design judgment to make it visually strong and clickable.\n\r\n\n\r\nRevisions are a normal part of the process as we refine thumbnails for performance.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nWhat We Need From You\n\r\n• Strong graphic design skills\n\r\n• Experience designing thumbnails specifically for YouTube\n\r\n• Ability to simplify and declutter images\n\r\n• Ability to create a clear visual “story” at small size\n\r\n• Ability to understand and visually convey emotion (especially animal expressions)\n\r\n• Ability to follow a design brief and implement feedback\n\r\n• Reliable communication and turnaround\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nHow Payment Works\n\r\n• Paid per thumbnail\n\r\n• Ongoing work available for designers who perform well\n\r\n• Paid tests required before joining our team\n\r\nDesigners work at their own pace, as long as deadlines are met.\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nHow to Apply (Important)\n\r\nTo apply, include the word fancy at the top of your message.\n\r\nPlease also include:\n\r\n• Your YouTube thumbnail design experience (channels or niches)\n\r\n• 2–5 samples of your YouTube thumbnails (links or portfolio)\n\r\n• Two or more of your thumbnails optimized for mobile\n\r\n• The graphic design software you use\n\r\n• Your typical turnaround time for one thumbnail\n\r\n________________________________________\n\r\nPaid Test\n\r\nIf your application is selected, the first step in the process is to start with a paid test to determine your skills and capabilities and fit for our needs.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for designers who want steady work and enjoy improving thumbnails to make them perform as well as possible.\n\r\n\n\r\nThanks — looking forward to seeing your work!\n\r\n________________________________________                ",

I am hiring a long-term virtual assistant to publish new stencil content every week, improve SEO (especially thin-content issues), and help grow traffic and revenue. We provide a custom AI tool that can generate stencil images, so you will be using our tool as part of the workflow. The weekly output target is 3 new uploads per week, and each upload should contain 3 to 8 stencil images (a stencil set). The stencil sets must match current trends such as upcoming holidays, seasonal topics, and what people are searching for (Google search trends). You will publish each stencil set in WordPress by uploading the images, ensuring proper file naming and alt text, placing the content in the correct categories/tags, and adding internal links to relevant pages on the site.\n\r\n\n\r\nPinterest is also required: you will upload the images to our Pinterest account by creating Pins for each new stencil set (and sometimes individual stencils if appropriate), writing keyword-focused Pin titles and descriptions, linking back to the correct page on our website, and saving Pins to the right boards consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nA major focus for this role is improving thin pages. Many pages in this niche can become “thin” if they only contain an image and little text. You must learn how to improve page quality by adding helpful text, usage ideas, simple instructions, FAQs, better formatting, and stronger internal linking so each page provides real value beyond the download. We are looking for Google SEO knowledge and experience to help improve the site performance. Experience with WordPress posting, on-page SEO, image optimization/compression, and Pinterest posting is important. Familiarity with SEO plugins and Google Search Console is a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonuses: Bonuses will be provided for improvements in website revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply: Please send your WordPress and SEO experience, any Pinterest work examples, and a short explanation of how you would improve a thin-content stencil page that is mostly images.

    "description": "\n                    I run a residential appraisal firm located in the Bay Area, California, and am looking for an experienced residential appraisal writer to join the team. The team includes 3 Bay Area appraisers and 6 employees in the Philippines. We are rapidly growing and are looking for an experienced and senior level residential report writer/manager to join our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role will be to do the following:\n\r\n1. Complete the entire residential appraisal report after the appraiser has provided you with the inspection information and comparables. This includes all the commentary, adjustments, and all other parts of the report. We will provide training on how we specifically expect the commentary and adjustments based on our own personal preferences, however you are expected to already have this type of experience working for other appraisers.\n\r\n2. Review the work of other report writers on our team, provide feedback, and help train newer report writers on our team. You are expected to act as the \"last line of defense\" of the report before it is sent to the appraiser for their final review before submission. As such, we expect you to be able to review the report, find any issues, correct these issues, and then send to the appraiser a near perfect report.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered for this role, you must meet the following criteria:\n\r\n1. You have worked for a US residential appraiser\n\r\n2. You have experience performing data entry for residential properties in the US\n\r\n3. You have experience creating the 1004MC, selecting comparables, drawing the sketch, labeling photos, making adjustments to the sales grid, and making commentary for the addendum.\n\r\n4. Ideally, you have experience managing other appraisal report writers.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are flexible with your work hours and offer Philippine daytime shift hours for your convenience. We would like to start part time but then transition to full time, so ideally you are open to working full time exclusively with us if its a mutual fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered for this position, you must do the following in your application message (failure to do all of the following will result in your application being ignored):\n\r\n1. How many years have you worked for a US residential appraiser? What tasks did you perform for them?\n\r\n2. How many hours does it take you to complete one report? What parts of the report do you complete?\n\r\n3. Do you have experience writing commentary for the addendum, drawing the sketch, labeling photos, and creating the 1004MC? Please indicate which ones you have experience with, and how many years for each.\n\r\n4. Please provide a sample of at least one appraisal report you have fully completed. You can redact any private information from the report. Please let me know what parts exactly you completed on this report(s).\n\r\n5. Provide a publicly accessible link to your resume.\n\r\n6. Are you open to starting part time and then transitioning to full time? Once working full time with us, will you be working exclusively with us without any other jobs? When is the earliest you can begin working with us?\n\r\n7. What are your preferred working hours?\n\r\n8. Do you have experience managing other residential appraisal report writers? If so, please discuss in detail your job responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you, and I look forward to the opportunity to work together.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Do you have an eye for what makes people stop scrolling?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run two media brands in the combat sports space. We have over 10 years of video content — thousands of hours of training footage, match clips, coaching sessions, and behind-the-scenes \nnts — sitting in a vault waiting to be turned into viral Shorts, Reels, and TikToks.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone obsessive about content to come in and systematically mine that library, find the gold, organize everything, and keep our social media engines running across multiple platforms and multiple brands every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a \"post once a day and call it done\" gig. You'll be the backbone of our entire content operation — the person who makes sure our video editor always has clips to cut, our content calendar is always full, and our audience is always being fed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Two Brands You'll Be Working Across:\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand 1 — Championship-level amateur wrestling instruction with 10+ years of training footage. Think intense, high-energy, coach-to-athlete content.\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand 2 — Combat sports education and analysis. Deep library of instructional and analytical content.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Mining & Organization (This Is the Big One — ~40% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Systematically watch through our entire video libraries for both brands\n\r\n- Log every video in a master spreadsheet: title, duration, topic, key \nnts with timestamps, \"gold rating\" (1–5), and suggested clip ideas\n\r\n- Identify the \nnts that would make great Shorts — high energy technique demos, dramatic reactions, clean takedowns, quotable coaching \nnts, training montages, rivalry clips\n\r\n- Tag and categorize content: technique tutorials, match footage, training sessions, coaching/motivational, behind-the-scenes, product-specific\n\r\n- Organize raw files into a clean, labeled folder structure so our editor can find and grab what they need instantly\n\r\n- Maintain and update the content log as new footage comes in\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Scheduling & Posting (~30% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Manage content calendars across both brands and all platforms (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok,\n)\n\r\n- Upload, write captions, add hashtags, and publish all finished content on schedule\n\r\n- Write captions from templates and brand voice guides we provide (you'll get trained on each brand's tone)\n\r\n- Schedule content in advance using tools like Metricool, Later, or native platform schedulers\n\r\n- Ensure we never miss a posting day — consistency is everything\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity Engagement & Performance Tracking (~20% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Monitor and reply to comments across all platforms (we'll give you response guidelines)\n\r\n- Flag DMs and comments that need the founders' attention\n\r\n- Track basic performance metrics weekly: views, engagement rate, follower growth, saves, shares\n\r\n- Maintain a simple weekly report — what posted, what performed, what flopped, and why you think so\n\r\n- Identify trending content in our niches and flag opportunities to jump on trends\n\r\n\n\r\nResearch & Support (~10% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Research trending audio, formats, hashtags, and content styles in the wrestling and combat sports niche\n\r\n- Scout competitor accounts and flag content ideas worth adapting or responding to\n\r\n- Maintain asset libraries: thumbnails, brand templates, music/audio files, b-roll folders\n\r\n- Assist with miscellaneous tasks as needed — we're a small team and flexibility matters\n\r\n\n\r\nYou MUST Have:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong English skills (written — we communicate via chat, Loom, and shared docs)\n\r\n- Experience managing social media accounts and posting content consistently (show us the accounts you've managed)\n\r\n- Familiarity with at least one scheduling tool (Later, Buffer, Metricool, Hootsuite, or native platform schedulers)\n\r\n- Attention to detail — you'll be logging hundreds of videos and we need accuracy, not sloppiness\n\r\n- Ability to work independently with minimal supervision after training\n\r\n- A genuine eye for engaging content — you can tell the difference between a clip that will get 500 views and one that will get 50,000\n\r\n- Reliable internet and a quiet workspace with headphones (you'll be watching hours of video daily)\n\r\n- Willingness to overlap with US Central Time (CST) for at least 3–4 hours daily\n\r\n- Proficiency with Google Drive, Google Sheets, and basic file management\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points (Not Required But We'll Love You For It):\n\r\n\n\r\n- Interest in wrestling, combat sports, or martial arts (understanding the content makes you faster)\n\r\n- Experience with short-form video platforms as a creator or avid consumer (if your own TikTok For You page is full of combat sports content, tell us)\n\r\n- Basic photo/video editing skills (even just CapCut-level trimming and captioning)\n\r\n- Experience with Canva for creating thumbnails or simple graphics\n\r\n- Familiarity with YouTube analytics, Instagram Insights, or TikTok analytics dashboards\n\r\n- Experience working with content creators or media brands (not just corporate social accounts)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat It's Like Working With Us:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Small team, fast-moving, zero bureaucracy\n\r\n- You'll work directly with the founders — not middle managers\n\r\n- We communicate async (Loom, Slack/chat) with a weekly sync call\n\r\n- We'll train you on exactly what \"gold\" content looks like — you don't need to figure it out alone\n\r\n- Clear expectations, direct feedback, and real growth opportunity\n\r\n- If you're great at this, there's room to grow into a content manager role as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply — READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe get a lot of applications. To make sure you actually read this post, do the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Start your application with the word **\"TAKEDOWN\"** so we know you read the full posting.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Watch this video: \n \n\r\n\n\r\n3. In your application, timestamp 3 specific \nnts from that video that you think would make great Shorts or Reels. For each \nnt, write 1-2 sentences explaining WHY you picked it — what makes it engaging, scroll-stopping, or shareable.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Send links to 2-3 social media accounts you've managed or contributed to. If you don't have professional examples, send your own personal accounts and tell us what content strategy you follow.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Tell us your available hours, timezone, and current workload (are you working other jobs?).\n\r\n\n\r\n**Do NOT send a generic application.** If your application doesn't start with \"TAKEDOWN\" and include timestamps, we won't read it.

    "description": "\n                    Fix Structured Data, Canonicals, H1 Issues + Improve CWV Performance\n\r\n\n\r\nHi! My name is Rhett and I'm the Marketing Manager at The Equine Practice Company \n/ (If you see a recent post on this, I have cancelled that task and made this project clearer to ensure there is no confusion on what we need you to do)\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m looking for an experienced Technical SEO Specialist to help fix several technical issues identified that we have with our website.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Equine Practice Company - a continuing education platform for equine veterinarians worldwide.\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me make this very clear before you apply.\n\r\n\n\r\n- This is not a content role or keyword research role.\n\r\n- This is a hands-on technical implementation project focused on:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Structured data (Schema / JSON-LD)\n\r\n- Entity linking (Organization ? Speakers)\n\r\n- Canonical + redirect consistency\n\r\n- Core Web Vitals performance improvements\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a one-time technical SEO implementation project. I'd prefer a fixed-price structure with clear milestones. If the work is done well, I may offer ongoing technical SEO support for future schema + performance needs to this website and our second website.\n\r\n\n\r\nI want someone who can fix this properly and document the work clearly.\n\r\n\n\r\nA. Current Website Setup\n\r\n\n\r\nTo save time, here is our technical environment:\n\r\n\n\r\nWebsite platform: WordPress\n\r\nTheme: Kadence\n\r\nSEO plugin: Rank Math\n\r\nHosting: WPX (Cloudflare available)\n\r\nCanonical preference: I don’t mind www vs non-www - I just want one version enforced consistently\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Schema & Structured Data Implementation (High Priority) We currently have gaps in structured data, and we need a clean schema setup using best practices.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will implement:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Organization schema site-wide\n\r\n- AboutPage schema\n\r\n- ContactPage schema + ContactPoint\n\r\n- Person schema for our “Meet the Speaker” pages\n\r\n- Proper entity linking (Organization ? Website ? Speakers)\n\r\n\n\r\nI want a hybrid approach:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Rank Math for baseline schema\n\r\n- Custom JSON-LD where needed (especially for Speaker Person schema)\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: Avoid duplicate/conflicting schema output.\n\r\n\n\r\nAll schema must be validated using:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Google Rich Results Test\n\r\n- \n Validator\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Homepage SEO Fix (H1 Hierarchy) - Our homepage currently has two H1 tags, which causes structural confusion for Google.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Fix the heading hierarchy (single clean H1)\n\r\n- Keep design intact (Kadence blocks)\n\r\n\n\r\nSuggested H1:\n\r\n\n\r\n“The Equine Practice Company – Continuing Education for Equine Veterinarians”\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Canonical + Domain Consistency (WWW vs Non-WWW) - We may have canonical duplication issues.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Audit canonical tags across templates\n\r\n- Enforce one preferred domain version via proper 301 redirects\n\r\n- Ensure Rank Math canonicals match server/CDN redirects\n\r\n- Confirm consistent indexing in Google Search Console\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Core Web Vitals + Performance Improvements (CWV) - Because this is a membership-based site, performance matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nI need help improving:\n\r\n\n\r\n- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n\r\n- TTFB (Time to First Byte)\n\r\n- INP / CLS issues if present\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Identify the top causes of poor CWV (mobile-first)\n\r\n- Optimize heavy scripts/plugins where possible\n\r\n- Recommend hosting/CDN improvements if needed\n\r\n\n\r\nRetest using:\n\r\n\n\r\n- PageSpeed Insights\n\r\n- Lighthouse\n\r\n- CrUX data\n\r\n\n\r\nIt is important that you document before/after results.\n\r\n\n\r\nMost Importantly, The Final Deliverables (What You Must Provide)\n\r\n\n\r\nAt completion of this project for our website, I expect:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Working JSON-LD schema for Organization, AboutPage, ContactPage, Person\n\r\n- Clean entity graph \n\r\n- Validation proof (screenshots or links)\n\r\n- Canonical + redirect mapping summary\n\r\n- Before/after homepage H1 structure proof\n\r\n- Core Web Vitals improvement report\n\r\n- Clear documentation of everything changed\n\r\n\n\r\nWho Is My Ideal Candidate For This Project - I'm looking for someone with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong WordPress technical SEO experience\n\r\n- Deep schema + JSON-LD knowledge (not just plugins)\n\r\n- Experience with Rank Math + Kadence themes\n\r\n- Understanding of Core Web Vitals (TTFB/LCP)\n\r\n- Ability to work independently and document clearly\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are a real technical implementer (not just an SEO auditor), I’d love to work with you.\n\r\n\n\r\n Please answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.What schema does Rank Math output by default, and how do you avoid duplication when adding custom Person schema?\n\r\n2. Where would you enforce the canonical domain version (WordPress vs Cloudflare vs server)?\n\r\n3. Share one example of Organization + Person JSON-LD you have implemented before (client details can be hidden).\n\r\n\n\r\nI'd prefer a fixed-price structure with clear milestones. What is your fixed price to complete this project and break it down in milestones.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease estimate how long this will take to fully complete the project.                ",

Your job is to turn that footage into engaging short-form videos, create multiple versions from the same recording, schedule posts, write captions, and track performance so we can repeat what works and improve what doesn’t. Instagram: \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is primarily video editing for Reels and TikTok (potentially YouTube shorts as well) . You’ll take raw clips and produce clean, engaging edits with strong hooks, good pacing, and clear on-screen text. We want you to make different versions from the same footage (for example, different openings, text overlays, or endings) so we can test what performs best. You should be comfortable adding subtitles or captions, light sound design, and exporting in the right formats for both platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will also help with planning and consistency. Each week you’ll build a simple posting schedule, prepare content ahead of time, and schedule uploads with captions. We want someone who can contribute ideas for a practical posting strategy to drive followers and engagement, and who understands how short-form content works (hooks, retention, testing variations, and learning from analytics). The goal is steady growth and a repeatable content system that fits an art account.\n\r\n\n\r\nOrganization matters. You will create and maintain a Google Sheet to track what we post and how it performs. This should include the post date/time, video type, hook style, length, caption approach, hashtags, and performance results. Once per week, you’ll share a short summary of what performed best and your best guess as to why, plus what you recommend we test next.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a part-time role to start (around 10–20 hours per week) with flexible hours, as long as weekly deliverables and deadlines are met. We want to form this into a full-time role long term. Please include your rate (hourly or weekly/monthly). We are open to hourly at the beginning and moving to a fixed deliverables structure once the workflow is consistent. If we work hourly, we may use OnlineJobs.ph TimeProof during working time only, and we’re happy to reduce or remove tracking once we establish trust and consistent results.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please send a short intro and your relevant experience editing Reels/TikToks, plus 2–4 examples of short-form edits you’ve done (portfolio links are fine). Tell us what editing tools you use, your typical turnaround time, and what weekly posting cadence you would suggest for an art/collage account like ours. Include your rate and your availability to start.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinalists may be asked to do a small paid test using a short raw clip we provide. You would create two 10–20 second edit variations with different hooks/text/endings, and provide a caption and hashtags.                ",
