I am a solo founder building a US-based technology startup called DearlySent. We are building a social relationship network designed to bridge the gap between digital intention and physical action. My goal over the next decade is to serve 100 million monthly active users and fundamentally change the way human beings show care and love to one another.\n\r\n\n\r\nI personally work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, and I absolutely love what I do. I am intensely driven, but I cannot scale this alone. I am looking for my right-hand partner. I am looking for someone with high fluid intelligence, deep empathy, and a builder’s mindset to join me on the ground floor.\n\r\n\n\r\n**My Promise to You (The Anti-Micromanagement Guarantee):**\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a daycare. You are an adult, and you will be treated as a peer and a partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n- I will **never** use Time Doctor, Hubstaff, or any screen-recording software.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- I will **never** force you to punch a clock.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- I do not want your mechanical hours; I want your mind, your heart, and your soul. We will work in symbiosis to build something incredible. I care about output, execution, and trust.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**The Trajectory & Compensation (The 4-Month Ramp):**\n\r\n\n\r\nI do not pay hourly, because I do not want you to have \"hours anxiety.\" If you build a system that saves us 10 hours a week, you should not be penalized with less pay. I pay a stable monthly salary for your output and ownership. We will scale your salary and your responsibilities together over the first four months:\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Month 1 (The Foundation): $800 USD / month.** Expectation is roughly 20 hours of focused output a week. You will learn the DNA of the company, help with Ritz-Carlton level customer care, execute rigorous QA testing of our app, and build our initial operations tracking.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 2 (The Builder): $1,200 USD / month.** Expectation grows to ~30 hours a week. You take over affiliate outreach, competitor research, manage video creators, and build our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 3 (The Operator): $1,600 USD / month.** Nearing full-time. You take over daily operations so I can focus purely on engineering and marketing. You manage the digital fulfillment prep and own customer support.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Month 4+ (The Partner): $2,000 USD / month.** Full-time ownership. You are officially my Chief of Staff. You manage the systems, and when we are task-saturated and need to hire more people, _you_ will lead the interviews.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**Long-Term Respect & Benefits:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **13th Month Pay:** I proudly and proactively pay the 13th-month bonus every December.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Healthcare:** Once you reach Month 4 (Full Partner status), you will receive an additional $50/month stipend specifically for your local HMO.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Growth:** A guaranteed minimum 5% annual pay raise, with room for much higher performance-based increases as the company's revenue scales.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n**Who You Are:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Flawless English:** You will be communicating with our premium US customer base and directly with me.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Empathetic:** You actually care about people. Our company exists to remind people of their value.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **A Systems Thinker:** You don't just solve a problem; you build a system so the problem never happens again.\n\r\n    \n\r\n- **Tech-Savvy:** You embrace AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to make yourself faster and smarter.\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n### **How to Apply (The 3-Phase Hiring Process):**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo find the perfect partner, I do not read generic cover letters. We are breaking this process into three phases to ensure we are a perfect fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 1: The Introduction**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a resume or a cover letter. Instead, record a 3-to-5 minute video (Loom, YouTube, etc.) answering these three exact questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Explain a complex technical or operational problem you solved in the past.\n\r\n    \n\r\n2. Tell me about a specific act of kindness you’ve done for someone recently, or something kind you would like to do for someone.\n\r\n    \n\r\n3. What is a piece of technology or software that you believe is perfectly engineered, and why?\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to Detail Check: Please make the subject line of your application message: \"Generosity: [Your Name]\" so I know you read this entire post).\n\r\nApplications without videos will be immediately deleted and not reviewed.  \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 2: The Deep Dive**\n\r\n\n\r\nI will review every single video. The top candidates will be invited to Round 2, where I will ask you to record a second video detailing your specific background, your career ambitions, and more personal details about who you are. \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 3: The Paid Trial**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe top finalists will be paid $50 USD to complete a real-world practice project for our company and take a brief alignment/personality assessment. You will be actively encouraged to use AI to complete this project.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe final candidate will be offered the position immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want to just clock in, do data entry, and clock out, please do not apply. If you want to build a unicorn startup, take ownership of a mission, and grow into a tech executive, send me your video. Let's build something incredible together.                ",

Instead, record a 3-to-5 minute video (Loom, YouTube, etc.) answering these three exact questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Explain a complex technical or operational problem you solved in the past.\n\r\n    \n\r\n2. Tell me about a specific act of kindness you’ve done for someone recently, or something kind you would like to do for someone.\n\r\n    \n\r\n3. What is a piece of technology or software that you believe is perfectly engineered, and why?\n\r\n    \n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to Detail Check: Please make the subject line of your application message: \"Generosity: [Your Name]\" so I know you read this entire post).\n\r\nApplications without videos will be immediately deleted and not reviewed.  \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 2: The Deep Dive**\n\r\n\n\r\nI will review every single video. The top candidates will be invited to Round 2, where I will ask you to record a second video detailing your specific background, your career ambitions, and more personal details about who you are. \n\r\n\n\r\n**PHASE 3: The Paid Trial**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe top finalists will be paid $50 USD to complete a real-world practice project for our company and take a brief alignment/personality assessment. You will be actively encouraged to use AI to complete this project.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe final candidate will be offered the position immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want to just clock in, do data entry, and clock out, please do not apply. If you want to build a unicorn startup, take ownership of a mission, and grow into a tech executive, send me your video. Let's build something incredible together.                ",

If a mistake reaches the client, it is your responsibility.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Candidate Profile\n\r\n\n\r\nWe aren't looking for a \"generalist.\" We are looking for an A-Player who sits at the intersection of these three specific domains:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The PM Stack (Operations & Accountability)\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Goal: 100% On-time delivery.\n\r\nThe Skill: You have experience (preferably 2-3+ years) managing technical or creative teams. You are great at resource allocation, managing team velocity, and maintaining project management suites (Notion, Linear, or ASANA). You don't just \"check in\"; you drive the timeline.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The QA Stack (Technical Precision)\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Goal: Zero defects.\n\r\nThe Skill: You are extremely detail-oriented. You notice the misalignments, logic flaws, or broken elements on a website that everyone else misses. Preferably, you also have an understanding of the technical logic behind what's happening on the website.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. The Leadership Stack (High Agency & Communication)\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Goal: Strategic focus for the leadership.\n\r\nThe Skill: You are comfortable being the \"bad guy\" when standards aren't met. You value \"Closing the Loop\"; if an error occurs, you update the SOP so it never happens again. You are a professional, direct communicator who can proactively communicate with clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Mindset\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh Agency: You don't wait for permission to fix a broken process.\n\r\nIntolerance of Mediocrity: You prioritize the end result.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Instructions\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, submit your CV, your motivations for applying, and a brief overview of your relevant experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, provide your tactical response to the following three scenarios:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. It’s Friday, 4:00 PM. A developer tells you a critical Shopify landing page build will be \"mostly ready\" by EOD, but they need Monday morning to \"clean up some minor mobile responsiveness issues.\" The client expects the launch on Monday at 9:00 AM. \n\r\n\n\r\n2. Our lead designer is brilliant, but consistently forgets to update changes across all pages in a project. You’ve mentioned it twice. Today, you found the same error again on a high-stakes project.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. A client messages you directly on a Friday evening asking for a \"small change\" after designs are approved and development is underway. You aren't sure if this aligns with the original strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do you handle each of these situations?\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.                ",

Our store receives strong, high-intent traffic and customers are actively reaching the checkout stage, however a significant percentage of users are not completing their checkout. We are looking for a highly experienced Shopify Checkout Optimization and Conversion Rate Optimization expert who can deeply analyze this issue, identify the root causes, and implement proven solutions that improve checkout completion and payment success rates.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is strictly for professionals with a minimum of five years of hands-on experience working with Shopify stores, specifically with checkout behavior, payment flow optimization, and conversion rate improvement. We are not looking for beginners, trainees, or general Shopify assistants. Only candidates with real-world experience fixing checkout abandonment issues on live Shopify stores should apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe selected expert will be responsible for auditing our Shopify checkout funnel, analyzing Shopify Analytics and payment failure data, identifying technical or user experience friction points, and determining why customers who reach checkout do not complete payment. This includes reviewing Shopify Payments behavior, card declines, address and ZIP code validation issues, mobile checkout usability, express payment adoption, and any other factors that may be impacting conversion at the final step. The expert must be capable of testing the checkout flow under real-world conditions, including mobile devices, different browsers, and different payment methods, and then implementing solutions directly within Shopify where required.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe expect the candidate to have deep knowledge of Shopify checkout behavior, Shopify Payments, Shop Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and overall US buyer payment expectations. Strong experience in conversion rate optimization is essential, including improving checkout trust, reducing friction, and increasing express checkout usage. The expert should be able to provide clear explanations, data-backed insights, and measurable improvements rather than assumptions or generic advice.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires someone who can work independently, communicate clearly, and take ownership of the problem from diagnosis through execution. We value transparency, accountability, and results. Prior experience working with US-based \n stores and\n traffic is highly preferred. Experience with Google Analytics or GA4, checkout testing, and CRO experimentation will be considered an advantage.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are only considering candidates with at least five years of proven Shopify experience and a strong track record of improving checkout conversion rates. Please do not apply if you do not meet this requirement. When applying, candidates should be prepared to explain similar checkout issues they have resolved in the past and the results they achieved.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a serious role for a serious expert. If you have the required experience and are confident in your ability to diagnose and fix checkout completion issues on a live Shopify store, we would like to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nShopify\n\r\nThis ensures the candidate has deep, hands-on experience with Shopify stores, checkout behavior, themes, payments, and real production environments.\n\r\n\n\r\nConversion Rate Optimization (CRO)\n\r\nThis targets experts who specialize in improving checkout completion, reducing abandonment, and fixing funnel drop-offs using data, UX, and testing.

Primarily providing expert cybersecurity consulting to a wide range of industries we are also have a project in stealth; a cybersecurity training platform built for people learning security based on real world experiences. What makes us different: students train on real infrastructure. We have a live cyber range with real VMs, a shared SIEM, and even real attackers hitting our honeypots.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm bootstrapping this and building it lean. That means you'll have real ownership over what you build, your work will matter from day one, and you won't be stuck in a bloated process. It also means we move fast and expect good judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n**What You'll Be Working On**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe core platform is live and built in a MVP capacity. Your job is to help me grow it. That means:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Building new features across the full stack (Django backend, Nuxt.js frontend)\n\r\n- Improving the learning experience – dashboards, labs, progress tracking, content delivery\n\r\n- Helping integrate infrastructure automation into the platform\n\r\n- Maintaining code quality and jumping in on bugs when needed\n\r\n- Occasionally contributing to our admin tools and internal tooling\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is fast-paced. We ship frequently, priorities shift, and I'll need someone who can adapt without hand-holding.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n**Tech Stack**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Backend:** Python / Django / Django REST Framework\n\r\n- **Frontend:** Nuxt.js 3 (Vue.js) / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS\n\r\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL\n\r\n- **Infrastructure:** AWS (hosting) + Azure (cyber range)\n\r\n- **Other:** Stripe, JWT auth, Pinia, REST APIs, TinaCMS\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n**What I'm Looking For**\n\r\n\n\r\nI care more about the right person than hitting a specific title. You might be mid-level with strong instincts or senior with deep Django/Vue experience – either works if you're sharp and self-directed.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're a great fit if you:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Have 3+ years of hands-on experience with Django and Vue.js (or Nuxt)\n\r\n- Can work independently – you don't need someone checking in on you daily\n\r\n- Communicate clearly and proactively in writing (we're async-first)\n\r\n- Take ownership of your work and flag problems early\n\r\n- Are comfortable picking up new tools and figuring things out\n\r\n- Use AI coding tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to move faster – but you understand the code you ship\n\r\n\n\r\n**Nice to have:**\n\r\n- Experience with cloud infrastructure (Azure or AWS)\n\r\n- Interest in cybersecurity (you don't need to be a hacker, just curious)\n\r\n- Experience building SaaS or subscription-based products\n\r\n- Familiarity with Stripe integrations\n\r\n- UI/UX Design experience\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n**What AI Tools Look Like Here**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm fully supportive of using AI coding assistants – they're part of modern development. What I care about is that you understand what you're shipping and can defend your decisions. Blindly copy-pasting without understanding it isn't acceptable.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n**Working Arrangement**\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Hours:** Full-time (40 hrs/week)\n\r\n- **Schedule:** Async-friendly – I don't require you online at specific hours, but I need reliable daily communication and reasonable turnaround on messages. We won't have daily stand-ups but I still expect you to accommodate to PST time zone for occasional meetings.\n\r\n- **Timezone:** Flexible – I work with async tools (Teams, Slack, Linear, GitHub) so overlap isn't required, but some overlap helps\n\r\n- **Communication:** English proficiency is important – clear written communication is a must\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n**Compensation**\n\r\n\n\r\n$1,000 – $2,000/month USD depending on experience. Paid monthly. As the platform or individual grows, compensation can grow with it.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n**How to Apply**\n\r\n\n\r\nSend me a message with:\n\r\n1. A brief intro about yourself and your background\n\r\n2. Examples of Django + Vue/Nuxt or similar projects you've worked on (GitHub, portfolio, or description)\n\r\n3. One thing you'd want to know about the platform or the role\n\r\n\n\r\nNo cover letter templates please – I read every application personally and I can tell.                ",

Our volume is manageable (usually around 15 calls per CSR per day). We expect you to lead by example, not just by telling people what to do.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own (non-negotiables)\n\r\n-You will make sure no rentals are missed. Every day you will check every lead source and make sure every opportunity has a real outcome.\n\r\n-You will review website form submissions and confirm whether they rented. If they did not rent, you will call them, log them properly in CallPotential, and document the result and next step.\n\r\n-You will review CallPotential leads and reservations daily, make sure the status is correct (Lead vs Reservation), verify outcomes, and follow up to close.\n\r\n-You will review inbound sales calls and make sure non-renters are called back with a real attempt to convert, and you will document what happened.\n\r\n-Every lead must end the day as one of three things: rented, didn’t rent (with the reason), or a scheduled follow-up with a specific date and time.\n\r\n-You will run a real call review and coaching system. This is not “we’ll review calls when we have time.”\n\r\n-The expectation is that you review sales calls daily (or meet a minimum standard if call volume spikes), and you review at least five service calls per day looking for service recovery issues.\n\r\n-When calls are weak—missed close, wrong information, tone problems, or a bad customer experience—you will send short, clear coaching feedback, coach the CSR directly, and make sure the correction shows up within the next 24–48 hours.\n\r\n-You will also save coaching examples into a simple training library so the whole team improves over time.\n\r\n-You will handle escalations and service recovery.\n\r\n-If someone is upset, did not rent because of the experience, or has a sensitive issue, you will personally follow up, fix the issue, and turn it into a win when possible.\n\r\n-You will make sure escalations are actually resolved, not just “handled.”\n\r\n-You will set the standard, train people, enforce quality, and hold the line. That includes hiring and training when needed, assigning tasks and expectations clearly, correcting problems quickly when performance slips, and keeping the team professional and consistent.\n\r\n-A non-negotiable part of this job is “close-the-loop” control.\n\r\n-You will review each CSR’s daily update. We do not accept status-only updates.\n\r\n-Every item must have a result or a next step.\n\r\n-Anything labeled “pending customer response” must have a follow-up plan and a scheduled date.\n\r\n-If something is not confirmed complete, it must be assigned a next action with an owner and a due time.\n\r\n-No dropped balls. No silent failures.\n\r\n\n\r\nReporting (daily + weekly)\n\r\n-Each day you will post a simple daily report so leadership has clarity and the team stays sharp.\n\r\n-That daily report must include: forms reviewed, leads and reservations reviewed, new rentals closed, open follow-ups, calls listened to, calls flagged, the patterns you are seeing, which CSRs missed closes, what coaching was given, unhappy customers identified and recovered, anything left open, and tomorrow’s focus.\n\r\n-Each week you will produce a scorecard showing leads vs rentals and conversion percent by source (website, CallPotential, inbound calls), performance by CSR (calls, rentals, conversion percent), top wins, and the top focus areas for next week.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re a great fit if…\n\r\nYou take ownership and solve problems instead of passing them around.\n\r\nYou’re a real coach who is clear and helpful, but firm when needed.\n\r\nYou like numbers and performance tracking.\n\r\nYour spoken and written English is excellent, and you’re confident on the phone.\n\r\nYou can lead with high standards without being toxic.\n\r\n\n\r\nSmall business reality\n\r\nRandom urgent things will come up sometimes. We want someone who stays calm, proposes options, makes decisions, and follows through.\n\r\nThis is not an executive assistant role, but it is a role for someone who solves problems.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply (required)\n\r\nPlease send your resume, and let us know what ownership means to you!

The work needs to be completed each morning once Xero has updated overnight. As long as the work is done and I can see results, the exact timing within the morning window is flexible.\n\r\n•Service window: 8:00am - 10:00am AEST (approximate)\n\r\n•Flexibility within that window based on workload\n\r\n•What matters: work is complete, accurate, and I can see the results\n\r\n•No micromanagement of hours if outcomes are delivered\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Values\n\r\n\n\r\nHighest Standards : Every figure is correct. Every reconciliation balances. Every statement is accurate. No sloppy work, no assumptions, no 'it's probably right'.\n\r\n\n\r\nOwnership: You own the numbers. If something doesn't balance, you find out why. If a payment is missing, you chase it. You don't wait to be told there's a problem.\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliver Results:  The work gets done every morning.

Ensure accuracy of amounts, services, and client details. Chase overdue payments.\n\r\n2 Accounts Payable Process supplier invoices, verify against purchase orders or approvals, schedule payments, and maintain accurate creditor records.\n\r\n3 Debt Collection Actively chase outstanding debts. Request and follow up on statements. Resolve queries promptly. Escalate aged debt as per agreed thresholds.\n\r\n4 Bank Reconciliation Reconcile all bank accounts daily once Xero updates. Identify and resolve discrepancies. No unmatched transactions left unaddressed.\n\r\n5 Multi-Entity Management Manage accounts across Australian and UAE entities. Maintain clean separation between entities. Ensure intercompany transactions are properly recorded.\n\r\n6 Statement Requests Request statements from suppliers and debtors as needed. Confirm balances. Identify and resolve any discrepancies between records.\n\r\n7 Query Resolution Respond to and resolve queries from clients, suppliers, and internal stakeholders. Don't let queries sit. Own them until resolved.\n\r\n8 Financial Statements Prepare monthly Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet for each entity. Ensure statements are accurate, complete, and delivered by agreed deadlines.\n\r\n9 Month-End Close Complete month-end close procedures. Ensure all transactions are posted, accruals are recorded, and accounts are ready for reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nEssential\n\r\n•Strong Xero experience (this is non-negotiable)\n\r\n•Experience managing accounts for multiple entities\n\r\n•Ability to prepare financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet)\n\r\n•Experience with accounts receivable, accounts payable, and bank reconciliation\n\r\n•Comfortable chasing payments and resolving queries professionally\n\r\n•Reliable internet and quiet workspace\n\r\n•Available within the 8:00am - 10:00am AEST service window\n\r\nDesirable\n\r\n•Accounting qualification (CPA, CA, or equivalent)\n\r\n•Experience with Australian accounting standards (UAE experience a plus)\n\r\n•Experience in a services or professional services business\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n•Bank accounts reconciled daily, no unexplained items\n\r\n•Invoices sent on time and accurately\n\r\n•Debts chased proactively, not aged silently\n\r\n•Queries resolved, not parked\n\r\n•Financial statements ready when needed, accurate and complete\n\r\n•I can see results each morning without having to ask\n\r\n•Problems flagged early, not discovered later\n\r\nThe Non-Negotiables\n\r\n•Accuracy is everything. If you're not sure, check. If you can't check, ask.\n\r\n•Don't let things age silently. If a debt is overdue, chase it. If a query is unresolved, resolve it.\n\r\n•Own your numbers. If something doesn't balance, it's your job to find out why.\n\r\n•Communicate proactively. If there's a problem, I should hear it from you first.\n\r\n•Results matter more than hours.
