(General hospitality — bartending, waiting tables, retail — does not qualify. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou submit template applications or generic resumes. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou're seeking part-time, short-term, or freelance work. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou cannot commit to U.S. Eastern Time business hours (9am–5pm EST). \n\r\n\n\r\nDO APPLY if: \n\r\n\n\r\nYou have worked in cruise guest services (ocean or river) OR have strong experience managing travel itineraries and bookings with exceptional attention to detail. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou are looking for a long-term, full-time remote role with a mission-driven, close-knit team that invests in your growth. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou are professional, detail-oriented, and genuinely passionate about creating excellent travel experiences. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou can work independently, follow documented processes, and ask questions when something is unclear. \n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a boutique travel agency based in Atlanta, GA (EST). We specialize in luxury river cruises — especially Viking — and offer white-glove support for discerning clients. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe're warm, organized, and passionate about creating unforgettable cruise experiences. Our team is small, collaborative, and committed to doing things right. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe have documented processes (SOPs) for most tasks — you won't be guessing. You'll be trained and supported, not thrown into the deep end. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for a talented Virtual Assistant to join us full-time. \n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For \n\r\n\n\r\nMust-Have: \n\r\n\n\r\nExperience in cruise guest services, travel bookings, or itinerary management (Executive assistant experience with complex travel coordination may also qualify) \n\r\n\n\r\nExcellent written English with a warm, polished, professional tone \n\r\n\n\r\nProven ability to work independently and manage detailed tasks remotely \n\r\n\n\r\nHigh attention to detail, follow-through, and accountability \n\r\n\n\r\nReliable high-speed internet and a quiet workspace \n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points: \n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with Viking Cruises or river cruising \n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with the MyViking Travel Advisor Portal (MVJ) \n\r\n\n\r\nHubSpot CRM experience (or fast learner with CRMs) \n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with booking portals, invoices, or guest information systems \n\r\n\n\r\nStrong time management and comfort with documented SOPs \n\r\n\n\r\nYour Role \n\r\n\n\r\nAs our Virtual Assistant, you'll be responsible for: \n\r\n\n\r\nDrafting client\ns (hold reminders, confirmation, follow-ups, courtesy responses, answer inquiries) \n\r\n\n\r\nUpdating HubSpot CRM and internal trackers — keeping booking statuses, contact details, and notes current \n\r\n\n\r\nCalling Viking Cruises and partners to verify information, request itineraries, or resolve booking questions \n\r\n\n\r\nSupporting the CEO and team with high-level administrative tasks \n\r\n\n\r\nManaging booking coordination from inquiry through post-travel follow-up \n\r\n\n\r\nCross-training across departments (Flights, Finance, Gifts, Marketing) as you grow in the role \n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this matters: Cross-training keeps your work interesting, builds a broader skill set, and opens paths to specialize or take on more responsibility over time. \n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Workflow Clarification \n\r\n\n\r\nSo expectations are clear: \n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll work directly with our staff as internal support — not as an independent agent. \n\r\n\n\r\nGuest/client\ns are drafts for review. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll have autonomy for routine messages, with clear guidance on when to escalate (pricing, payments, sensitive situations). \n\r\n\n\r\nSome responses require an empathetic, reassuring tone; others follow standard templates. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be trained on our systems (HubSpot, booking trackers, Outlook) and supported by an experienced team invested in your success. \n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule \n\r\n\n\r\nTarget hours: 9:00am to 5:00pm EST (this is evening/night shift in the Philippines — please confirm this works for you) \n\r\n\n\r\nHours may vary based on business needs. \n\r\n\n\r\nSaturday coverage may be required later via rotation, but only once you are well trained. \n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply \n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that don't follow these instructions will not be reviewed.

    "description": "\n                    Overview\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term Growth Role\n\r\nThis is a part-time, long-term role designed to grow with the business. Compensation increases are tied to demonstrated ownership, autonomy, and impact — not tenure. As the business scales and your scope expands, pay will increase accordingly.\n\r\n\n\r\nI run an early-stage content agency and need someone who can own cold\n outreach from zero to live campaigns. This is not a beginner role. This is not a generic VA or assistant role. This is a specialist operator role for someone who has already run cold\n systems end-to-end.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to design, execute, and optimize cold\n campaigns that book qualified sales calls while maintaining excellent deliverability. You must be capable of handling cold\n from zero to live campaigns without hand-holding.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn plain English: You own the cold\n channel. You identify who to target, build the lists, set up the infrastructure, write the sequences, launch the campaigns, and optimize for results. If you do your job well, I should think about cold\n *less*, not more.\n\r\n\n\r\nTime Commitment: This is a part-time role averaging 10-20 hours per week. Time fluctuates: higher intensity during setup and iteration phases (15-20 hours), lower ongoing time once systems are stable (10-15 hours). You're paid for ownership, results, and reliability—not hours worked.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role owns cold\n execution, not overall growth strategy or sales leadership. You're expected to figure things out independently and take ownership of outcomes, not just complete tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nICP & Targeting:\n\r\n- Identify and define the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) based on business goals\n\r\n- Think strategically about targeting, not just \"send more\ns\"\n\r\n- Source and scrape high-quality lead lists aligned with the ICP\n\r\n\n\r\nInfrastructure & Setup:\n\r\n- Set up and manage\n infrastructure (domains, inboxes, warm-up understanding)\n\r\n- Understand and implement deliverability best practices (DNS, SPF, DKIM, warming, volume control)\n\r\n- Set up campaigns inside Instantly (mandatory tool)\n\r\n- Use Apollo, Clay, Smartlead, or similar tools as needed\n\r\n\n\r\nCampaign Execution:\n\r\n- Write, test, and iterate cold\n sequences (no spam, no gimmicks)\n\r\n- Launch and manage multiple campaigns simultaneously\n\r\n- Maintain deliverability as the #1 priority at all times—never compromise it\n\r\n- Handle inbox replies and route qualified leads to booking\n\r\n\n\r\nOptimization & Reporting:\n\r\n- Monitor and improve open rates, reply rates, positive reply rates, and booking rates\n\r\n- Track performance and report results clearly\n\r\n- Identify bottlenecks and optimize campaigns independently\n\r\n\n\r\nThe goal: I should be able to give you a business goal and trust that you'll build, launch, and optimize cold\n campaigns that book qualified calls—without me managing the process or thinking about deliverability.\n\r\n\n\r\nNon-Negotiables\n\r\n\n\r\nProven Experience (Required):\n\r\n- Hands-on experience running cold\n campaigns end-to-end\n\r\n- Deep understanding of deliverability (DNS, SPF, DKIM, warming, volume control)\n\r\n- Experience with Instantly (mandatory)\n\r\n- Experience with Apollo, Clay, Smartlead, or similar tools\n\r\n- Track record of maintaining deliverability while scaling campaigns\n\r\n- Zero tolerance for burning domains or reckless scaling\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills & Mindset (Required):\n\r\n- Strong written English (you're writing\ns that get replies)\n\r\n- Ability to think strategically about ICP and targeting\n\r\n- High ownership and accountability\n\r\n- Comfortable working with minimal oversight\n\r\n- Ability to figure things out independently\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're NOT Looking For:\n\r\n- Beginners who want to learn cold\n\r\n- Generic VAs or assistants\n\r\n- People who only know theory, not execution\n\r\n- People who need step-by-step instructions\n\r\n- People who can't maintain deliverability\n\r\n- Freelancers looking for hourly work\n\r\n- People who prioritize speed over deliverability\n\r\n\n\r\nSuccess Metrics\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Outcomes:\n\r\n- Booked calls (primary outcome)\n\r\n- Deliverability health maintained (never compromised)\n\r\n- Reply rate and positive reply rate\n\r\n- Open rate\n\r\n\n\r\nBy day 30, you should be:\n\r\n- Running live campaigns with healthy deliverability\n\r\n- Booking qualified sales calls consistently\n\r\n- Maintaining open rates above industry benchmarks\n\r\n- Reporting results clearly and proactively\n\r\n\n\r\nThe test: Can I give you a business goal and trust you'll build, launch, and optimize campaigns that book calls—without me thinking about deliverability or campaign management? If yes, you're succeeding.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is Perfect For\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're perfect for this if:\n\r\n- You've run cold\n campaigns end-to-end before\n\r\n- You understand deliverability deeply (not just theoretically)\n\r\n- You can think strategically about ICP and targeting\n\r\n- You write clear, effective cold\ns that get replies\n\r\n- You own outcomes, not just complete tasks\n\r\n- You work independently and figure things out\n\r\n- You're comfortable with tools like Instantly, Apollo, Clay\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT for you if:\n\r\n- You're a beginner who wants to learn cold\n\r\n- You're a generic VA or assistant\n\r\n- You only know theory, not hands-on execution\n\r\n- You need step-by-step instructions for everything\n\r\n- You can't maintain deliverability\n\r\n- You're looking for hourly or task-based work\n\r\n- You prioritize speed over deliverability\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements & Traits\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Requirements:\n\r\n- Proven hands-on experience - You've run cold\n campaigns end-to-end before\n\r\n- Deep deliverability knowledge - DNS, SPF, DKIM, warming, volume control\n\r\n- Strategic thinking - You think about ICP and targeting, not just volume\n\r\n- Strong written English - You write\ns that get replies\n\r\n- High ownership - You own outcomes, not just tasks\n\r\n- Independent execution - You figure things out without hand-holding\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You Must Know:\n\r\n- Instantly (mandatory)\n\r\n- Apollo, Clay, Smartlead, or similar (required)\n\r\n-\n infrastructure setup and management (required)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We'll Provide:\n\r\n- Access to tools and platforms\n\r\n- Business goals and context\n\r\n- Feedback on results\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Won't Provide:\n\r\n- Step-by-step instructions on how to run campaigns\n\r\n- Hand-holding through deliverability setup\n\r\n- Basic training on cold\n fundamentals\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication & Reporting\n\r\n\n\r\nResults-Focused Communication:\n\r\n- Weekly performance reports with clear metrics (booked calls, reply rates, deliverability health)\n\r\n- Proactive communication when deliverability is at risk (immediate) or campaigns need attention\n\r\n- Clear, concise reporting—no busywork\n\r\n\n\r\nOwnership:\n\r\n- When you own something, you see it through to completion\n\r\n- You don't wait for direction—you take initiative\n\r\n- You think ahead and anticipate problems\n\r\n- You optimize campaigns independently\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical: If deliverability is at risk or campaigns are underperforming, you must communicate immediately. Deliverability is the #1 priority—never compromise it. Burning domains or reckless scaling is unacceptable.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly salary: $450-$700/month USD (based on proven experience and results)\n\r\n- Starting closer to $450 for most\n\r\n- Performance-based increases after 60-90 days based on results and ownership\n\r\n- Fully remote position with flexible hours\n\r\n- Long-term position with growth potential as we scale\n\r\n- Direct access to founder—you'll work closely with me\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Salary Range?\n\r\nThis reflects intermediate specialist expertise and outcome ownership for a part-time role. You're paid for taking responsibility for cold\n campaigns that book calls—not for hours worked. This is a long-term relationship, not short-term execution.

    "description": "\n                    Overview\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term Growth Role\n\r\nThis is a full-time, long-term role designed to grow with the business. Compensation increases are tied to demonstrated ownership, autonomy, and impact — not tenure. As the business scales and your scope expands, pay will increase accordingly.\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m a content agency founder in the early stages. I need a generalist operations assistant who can handle execution now and evolve into coordination as we scale. Your job is to own content operations end-to-end so I can focus on strategy, content creation, and revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn plain English: this role exists to take content execution completely off my plate. If you do your job well, I should think about content *less*, not more.\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-term, this role is designed to become my right hand for content execution and coordination.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy “Operations Assistant”? This title reflects execution + ownership. You’re not an Executive Assistant (no calendar management or admin work). You’re not a Manager (you coordinate work, you do not manage people). You’re a generalist operator who owns outcomes and removes mental load fro\n.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat this means: You’re a GENERALIST who handles many things early and coordinates later. We’re early-stage. Specialists (editors, designers) may not always be available, so you’ll handle basic execution early on. As we hire specialists, your role transitions to coordinating them.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour primary job is to get content published, distributed, tracked, and organized—without me having to think about it.\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical clarifications:\n\r\n- You coordinate work, you do not manage people.\n\r\n- You execute strategy; you do not create it.\n\r\n- This is an operator role, not an administrative VA role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn’t a task-taker role. It’s a high-agency position where you’ll make judgment calls, solve problems independently, and own outcomes under ambiguity and incomplete instructions. You don’t own strategy or creative direction — but you are expected to use judgment daily in execution. Most importantly, you’ll communicate clearly and consistently so I can trust you’re handling everything.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ONE Thing You Must Own First\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Operations End-to-End\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom the \nnt I hand you an edited video, graphic, or piece of content, you own it until it’s published and tracked. This means:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Publishing - Get content live on all required platforms on schedule\n\r\n- Distribution - Handle cross-posting, scheduling, and platform-specific formatting\n\r\n- Tracking - Maintain records of what’s published where, when, and how it performed\n\r\n- Quality Control - Review everything before it goes live (catch errors, formatting issues, broken links)\n\r\n- Organization - Keep assets, files, and publishing records organized and accessible\n\r\n\n\r\nThe goal: I should be able to hand you a finished asset and trust that it will be published correctly, on time, and tracked—without me checking in or managing the process.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce you’ve proven you can own this completely, we’ll expand your responsibilities (see “How This Role Evolves” below).\n\r\n\n\r\nEarly-Stage Reality: What You’ll Do vs. What You’ll Evolve Into\n\r\n\n\r\nEarly On (When Specialists Aren’t Always Available):\n\r\nAs a generalist, you will handle basic execution tasks:\n\r\n- Basic script writing (often AI-assisted, with my direction on hooks and structure)\n\r\n- Light content adjustments and refinements\n\r\n- Quality control and final checks before publishing\n\r\n- Handling basic execution early (scripts, uploads, coordination)\n\r\n\n\r\n**What You Will NOT Be Doing:**\n\r\n- Deep creative strategy or brand positioning\n\r\n- Professional video editing (we hire video editors for this)\n\r\n- Professional graphic design (we hire designers for this)\n\r\n- Making final brand or positioning decisions\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: I own strategy, creative direction, and final content decisions. You own execution and operations.\n\r\n\n\r\nSecondary Responsibilities (Earned Through Ownership)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll earn these responsibilities by proving ownership first. These emphasize owning outcomes, not completing tasks. You’ll learn tools and workflows quickly because you own the results:\n\r\n\n\r\nClient Operations (after content operations is mastered)\n\r\n- Own client onboarding from start to finish\n\r\n- Own deliverables and timelines\n\r\n- Own routine client communications\n\r\n\n\r\nTeam Coordination (as we hire specialists)\n\r\n- Coordinate with video editors, designers, and other contractors\n\r\n- Own quality standards enforcement (you’re not managing people—you’re coordinating work)\n\r\n- Own workflows and handoffs\n\r\n\n\r\nSystems & Documentation (ongoing)\n\r\n- Own process documentation as you execute\n\r\n- Own bottleneck identification and improvements\n\r\n- Own systems that scale as we grow\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring Support (after trust is established - MAY assist, not guaranteed)\n\r\n- May assist with hiring coordination (posting jobs, filtering applicants, running trials)\n\r\n- May assist with onboarding new tea\nmbers\n\r\n\n\r\nThe key: You earn these by demonstrating ownership of content operations first. These responsibilities are earned through ownership, not promised upfront. This role MAY assist with hiring coordination and quality control later—but this does NOT imply immediate people management, authority over tea\nmbers, or strategic decision-making.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow This Role Evolves\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 1 (First 30-60 Days):\n\r\n- Own content operations end-to-end\n\r\n- Own publishing, distribution, and tracking completely\n\r\n- Handle basic execution tasks when specialists aren’t available (script writing, light adjustments)\n\r\n- Document processes as you learn them\n\r\n- Prove you can operate independently\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 2 (As We Hire Specialists):\n\r\n- Own coordination with video editors, designers, and other contractors\n\r\n- Own client operations and onboarding\n\r\n- Own quality standards enforcement across the team\n\r\n- Own bottleneck identification and solutions\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 3 (After Trust Is Established):\n\r\n- May assist with hiring coordination and onboarding (earned, not guaranteed)\n\r\n- Own central operations across the content engine (coordinating work, not managing people)\n\r\n- Own strategic execution (executing initiatives I’ve outlined, not creating strategy)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Always Stays With Me (The Founder):\n\r\n- Strategy and business direction\n\r\n- Creative direction and content ideas\n\r\n- Final brand decisions and positioning\n\r\n- Client relationship strategy\n\r\n- Revenue and business model decisions\n\r\n\n\r\nHow Growth Happens:\n\r\nGrowth comes through demonstrated ownership, reliability, and initiative—not promises or titles. You’re paid for ownership and reliability, not seniority or titles. You make daily judgment calls within execution and operate under ambiguity and incomplete instructions. The role grows organically based on what you can actually handle. If this works long-term, this role can evolve into a senior operations or content coordination position.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is Perfect For\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re perfect for this if:\n\r\n- You thrive on ownership and responsibility\n\r\n- You handle ambiguity and make judgment calls without constant direction\n\r\n- You’re organized, proactive, and think in systems\n\r\n- You communicate clearly and consistently (this is critical)\n\r\n- You want to grow with a business and take on more responsibility over time\n\r\n- You balance multiple priorities and shifting deadlines\n\r\n- You’re okay doing basic execution early on, knowing you’ll evolve into coordination\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT for you if:\n\r\n- You need detailed step-by-step instructions for everything\n\r\n- You prefer to wait for direction rather than take initiative\n\r\n- You struggle with ambiguity or changing priorities\n\r\n- You want to be a pure specialist (editor, designer, strategist)\n\r\n- You’re looking for a simple task-completion role\n\r\n- You want to focus only on creative work (this is operations-focused)\n\r\n- You want a title more than responsibility\n\r\n- You’re uncomfortable with ambiguity and incomplete instructions\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements & Traits\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Requirements (What We’re Hiring For - Core Criteria):\n\r\n- Ownership and reliability - You take responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks. You show up every day and follow through.\n\r\n- Strong English communication (written and spoken) - This is non-negotiable\n\r\n- High agency mindset - You figure things out before asking (but you do ask when stuck)\n\r\n- Attention to detail - You catch mistakes and inconsistencies\n\r\n- Proactive problem-solving - You think ahead and anticipate needs\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re NOT Looking For:\n\r\n- Prior mastery of our specific tools or processes (we’ll teach you)\n\r\n- Years of experience in content operations (ownership matters more)\n\r\n- A long list of specialist skills (we’re hiring for mindset and execution, not experience breadth)\n\r\n\n\r\nEarly-Stage Skills (Valuable But Not Required):\n\r\n- Basic script writing ability (often AI-assisted)\n\r\n- Basic understanding of what makes content perform (hooks, retention, virality)\n\r\n- Light content adjustment and refinement skills\n\r\n- Experience with content management, publishing, or operations\n\r\n- Familiarity with social media platforms and scheduling tools\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: You are not expected to be an expert in everything. You are expected to figure things out and communicate clearly. These early-stage skills are helpful but not required. We’re primarily hiring for ownership and reliability. You’ll learn tools and workflows quickly because you own outcomes, not just complete tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’ll Teach You:\n\r\n- Our specific workflows and publishing processes\n\r\n- Our tools and systems\n\r\n- Our quality standards and expectations\n\r\n- How we want things done\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Can’t Teach:\n\r\n- Ownership mindset\n\r\n- Proactive communication\n\r\n- Judgment and decision-making\n\r\n- Reliability and consistency\n\r\n\n\r\n30-Day Success Definition\n\r\n\n\r\nBy day 30, you will:\n\r\n- Own all publishing and distribution without me checking\n\r\n- Own tracking all published content accurately\n\r\n- Own catching quality issues before content goes live\n\r\n- Own daily communication without me having to ask\n\r\n- Own making judgment calls on routine publishing decisions\n\r\n- Own documenting processes as you execute them\n\r\n\n\r\nThe test: Can I hand you a finished asset and trust it will be published correctly, on time, and tracked—without me thinking about it? If yes, you’re succeeding.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication, Ownership, and Feedback Expectations\n\r\n\n\r\nDaily Communication (MANDATORY):\n\r\n- Daily Slack communication is mandatory\n\r\n- You’ll send a daily update via Slack covering:\n\r\n- What you completed today\n\r\n- What problems you ran into (and how you solved them or need help)\n\r\n- What you need fro\n (if anything)\n\r\n- This isn’t micromanagement—it’s accountability and visibility\n\r\n- Visibility and accountability matter more than speed\n\r\n- Disappearing when stuck is unacceptable\n\r\n\n\r\nOwnership:\n\r\n- When you own something, you see it through to completion\n\r\n- You don’t disappear when you get stuck—you communicate the problem\n\r\n- You think ahead and anticipate needs\n\r\n- You take initiative to improve processes\n\r\n\n\r\nFeedback:\n\r\n- I’ll give you direct, honest feedback to help you succeed\n\r\n- You should ask questions when unclear, not guess\n\r\n- We’ll iterate on processes together\n\r\n- The goal is continuous improvement, not perfection on day one\n\r\n\n\r\nCritical: If you get stuck on something, you must tell me. Disappearing when stuck is the #1 reason these relationships fail. I’m here to help you succeed—but I can’t help if I don’t know there’s a problem.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Monthly salary: $800-$1,100/month USD (based on ownership demonstrated, not years of experience)\n\r\n- Starting closer to $800 for most\n\r\n- Increases based on trust, autonomy, and results\n\r\n- Salary review after 90 days with opportunity for increase\n\r\n- Fully remote position with flexible hours\n\r\n- Long-term position with growth potential as we scale\n\r\n- Opportunity to build systems and processes from the ground up\n\r\n- Direct access to founder—you’ll work closely with me\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Salary Range?\n\r\nHigher pay reflects ownership, judgment, and reliability—not seniority or titles. This is not paid like a task-based VA role. You’re paid for taking responsibility, making judgment calls, and removing mental load fro\n. We’re looking for a long-term tea\nmber, not a freelancer. Monthly salary shows commitment from both sides. As we grow, your responsibilities and compensation will grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Filipino workers typically receive a 13th month bonus (one month’s salary paid in December, pro-rated for first year). We’ll discuss this during salary negotiation.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include the word “OPS555” at the end of your application subject line so we know you read this posting carefully.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include:\n\r\n- Your resume/CV\n\r\n- A brief cover letter explaining:\n\r\n- Why you’re interested in this type of role (high-agency, execution-focused operations)\n\r\n- An example of a time you took ownership of something ambiguous and figured it out\n\r\n- How you handle multiple priorities and shifting deadlines\n\r\n- Your salary expectations within our range ($800-$1,100/month)\n\r\n- Your availability (hours per week, timezone)\n\r\n- Confirmation that you can communicate daily via Slack\n\r\n- One question you have about this role\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus (optional but encouraged):\n\r\n\n\r\nIn 3–5 bullet points, briefly describe how you would take a finished video file and get it published across multiple platforms end-to-end without further instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For in Applications:\n\r\n- Clear, professional English communication\n\r\n- Evidence of ownership and initiative (not just task completion)\n\r\n- Understanding that this is an execution/operations role where you use judgment daily\n\r\n- Attention to detail (did you include “OPS555” in the subject?)

You set your price per video in your application.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a growing content agency creating long-form YouTube content for digital businesses. We need a Video Editor who can take raw footage (including talking head and other formats) and deliver polished long-form YouTube videos in two distinct editing styles. This is a long-term role with consistent volume as we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Care About Most\n\r\n\n\r\nMore than your tools or years of experience, we care about your integrity, commitment, and ability to match a style brief. We’re looking for someone who shows up on time, follows through on commitments, pays attention to reference examples, and wants to grow with our business. You must be able to edit in both of the styles we use—not just one.\n\r\n\n\r\nPosition Overview\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be responsible for:\n\r\n- Editing long-form YouTube videos (typically 8–25+ minutes) in two distinct styles\n\r\n- Matching the pacing, cuts, graphics, and feel of each style based on reference examples we provide\n\r\n- Working from raw footage (which may include talking head segments, screen recordings, B-roll, and other assets)\n\r\n- Delivering consistent quality, clear audio, and strong retention-friendly structure\n\r\n- Meeting agreed deadlines and turnaround times\n\r\n- Communicating clearly in English (written and, when needed, short calls)\n\r\n\n\r\nContent type: Long-form YouTube only. We do not need short-form (Reels/TikTok/Shorts) for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume: We have ongoing long-form video needs. Work is assigned per project; volume will grow as we add more channels and clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing Style Examples (Required Review)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe use two different long-form YouTube styles. You must be able to edit in both.\n\r\n\n\r\nStyle 1 – Example video:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStyle 2 – Example video:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease watch both examples in full before applying. In your application, briefly confirm you’ve watched them and describe how your experience fits each style (e.g. pacing, graphics, use of B-roll, chapter structure). Applications that don’t reference these two examples will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n- A strong understanding of retention in video editing (required)\n\r\n- Experience editing long-form YouTube (or similar) content – portfolio required\n\r\n- Ability to match a given style from reference videos (both styles above)\n\r\n- Strong English communication (written; occasional short calls)\n\r\n- Reliable and consistent – we need someone we can count on for deadlines\n\r\n\n\r\nWe can teach you our exact workflows, file naming, and delivery process. We can’t teach reliability, attention to reference, or the ability to replicate a style. If you have long-form YouTube editing experience and a portfolio that shows style flexibility, we want to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nPortfolio required. Applications without portfolio links (preferably YouTube links to long-form videos you’ve edited) will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Per-project payment – you quote your price per video in your application (e.g. per 10-min video, or per finished minute; state your rate clearly)\n\r\n- Ongoing work as we scale – consistent projects for the right editor\n\r\n- Fully remote, flexible hours\n\r\n- Long-term collaboration with growth potential\n\r\n\n\r\nHiring process: After initial screening, we’ll ask shortlisted candidates to complete one paid test edit (we’ll provide raw footage and a style reference). This lets us evaluate your ability to match our styles and your working process before we agree on ongoing rates.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Start your application subject line with the word “LONG555” so we know you read this posting.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include:\n\r\n- Your resume/CV\n\r\n- A portfolio link (REQUIRED) – preferably long-form YouTube videos you’ve edited\n\r\n- A short cover letter that:\n\r\n- Confirms you’ve watched both style example videos above\n\r\n- Briefly explains how your experience fits each style\n\r\n- Your per-project rate (e.g. $X per video, or $X per finished minute – state clearly how you price long-form edits)\n\r\n- Your availability (timezone and typical turnaround per video)\n\r\n- How many long-form videos per week you can comfortably deliver while maintaining quality\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need a long-form YouTube editor who can deliver in both of our styles, on time and to a high standard. If you’re reliable, detail-oriented, and able to match reference styles, we want to hear from you.                ",
