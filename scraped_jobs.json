    "description": "\n                    B2B Outreach & Qualification\n\r\nVirtual Assistant — Private Clinics\n\r\nEngland, Scotland, Wales & Ireland  |  Part-Time, Remote  |  Growth Role\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe are looking for a structured and professional Virtual Assistant to support outreach to private appointment-based clinics across England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe operate VioConcierge — an AI-powered appointment confirmation system that reduces no-shows and significantly cuts manual admin workload for clinics. The system is positioned as a premium implementation, not a commodity product.\n\r\n\n\r\nClinics do not purchase immediately. Instead, qualified clinics enter through our 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience — a structured onboarding phase where VioConcierge is implemented and performance is measured in real time. After this experience, suitable clinics transition to the full monthly system.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibility is to identify and qualify clinics for entry into this experience. You are the first point of contact and the gatekeeper for the programme.\n\r\n\n\r\n“This is a structured outreach and qualification role. Not a closing role.”\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\r\nYour day-to-day will involve a focused set of outreach and qualification activities:\n\r\nResearching private clinics (dental, aesthetics, physio, medical, and similar)\n\r\nSending personalised LinkedIn and\n outreach messages\n\r\nOpening professional conversations with clinic owners and practice managers\n\r\nAsking structured qualification questions to assess fit\n\r\nInviting suitable clinics to complete our application form\n\r\nUpdating a weekly KPI tracker accurately and consistently\n\r\nSubmitting a weekly performance summary\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Is Not a Sales Closing Role\n\r\nIt is important to be clear about what this role does not involve. All commercial discussions happen internally once a clinic has been qualified through you.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will not:\n\r\nDiscuss pricing or payment terms\n\r\nNegotiate plans or packages\n\r\nClose sales or make commercial promises\n\r\nGuarantee outcomes to prospects\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Explaining to Clinics\n\r\nTo qualify leads effectively, you will need a solid understanding of what VioConcierge delivers. The key facts you will be communicating are:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience is completely free of charge.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere is no setup cost, no subscription commitment, and no obligation during the 21 days. The clinic receives everything — including VioConcierge credits — at no cost. This is a genuine, risk-free experience, not a trial with hidden conditions.\n\r\n\n\r\nDuring the 21 days, participating clinics:\n\r\nImplement the VioConcierge system within their existing workflows\n\r\nSee measurable reductions in appointment no-shows\n\r\nReduce time spent on manual confirmation calls and follow-ups\n\r\nImprove consistency of patient communication\n\r\nReceive a structured performance report at the end of the 21 days\n\r\n\n\r\nClinics that wish to continue after the 21 days move onto the full VioConcierge monthly system, which involves a setup fee and monthly subscription. That conversation happens entirely with us — not with you. Your role ends at the application.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe experience is selective. We do not invite every clinic that enquires. Part of your role is to ensure only genuinely suitable clinics progress to application.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation Structure\n\r\nThis role pays a fixed USD $500 per month, structured as a base availability fee plus a performance component. There is no ambiguity about what you earn or why.\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly Retainer — USD $500 total\n\r\nThe retainer has two components:\n\r\n\n\r\nBase Availability Fee: USD $350 per month — paid unconditionally each month, provided you are available for required hours and submit your weekly KPI reports.\n\r\nPerformance Component: up to USD $150 per month — paid in full or in part based on your verified application count for that month.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance tiers for the monthly component:\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: In your first calendar month, the full $150 performance component is paid regardless of application count. This gives you time to establish your outreach rhythm before tiers apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional Earnings\n\r\nUSD $5.00 per verified application — every confirmed, qualified application earns you $5 on top of the retainer, paid monthly.\n\r\nUSD $25.00 conversion bonus — paid each time a clinic you sourced completes the 21-day experience and subscribes to the full VioConcierge system.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Could Realistically Earn\n\r\nA VA consistently hitting mid-range targets — around 20 verified applications per month and one conversion — earns:\n\r\n\n\r\n$500 retainer (full performance component unlocked)\n\r\n$100 in application fees (20 apps × $5)\n\r\n$25 conversion bonus\n\r\nTotal: approximately $625 USD per month, part-time\n\r\n\n\r\nAt strong performance — 30 applications and two conversions — total monthly earnings reach approximately $700 USD. Every metric above the floor goes directly into your pocket.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation will increase with performance and as the role scales.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Expectations — Month 1\n\r\nWe measure quality and targeting over raw volume. Week-on-week improvement matters more than hitting every number from day one.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly targets:\n\r\n200–300 personalised outreach messages\n\r\n20–40 replies\n\r\n5–10 completed applications\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth Opportunity\n\r\nThis role begins focused on private clinics across England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. As performance metrics are proven and the system scales, there is a clear pathway to grow into:\n\r\nSenior Sales Development role\n\r\nTerritory Expansion Lead\n\r\nRevenue-based compensation structure\n\r\nFull-time revenue position\n\r\n\n\r\nWe build for the long term and strongly prefer to promote from within.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are Looking For\n\r\nYou must have:\n\r\nExcellent written professional English\n\r\nComfort with structured B2B outreach processes\n\r\nThe discipline to follow scripts and qualification frameworks precisely\n\r\nStrong KPI tracking habits and consistent weekly reporting\n\r\nAvailability to overlap at least 2–3 hours with UK business hours\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred:\n\r\nPrevious B2B outreach or SDR experience\n\r\nLinkedIn outreach experience\n\r\nExperience targeting healthcare, dental, or clinic businesses\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not suited to high-volume automation approaches, mass broadcasting tools, or commission-only closers. We represent a premium implementation experience and expect our outreach to reflect that standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nTone Standard\n\r\nAll outreach on behalf of VioConcierge should feel professional, direct, and respectful of the clinic owner’s time. We are not selling a software subscription — we are inviting a select group of clinics into a structured programme that costs them nothing to experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience is completely free of charge to the clinic. There is no obligation, no setup cost during the 21 days, and no commitment required. This is a genuine, no-risk offer — and your outreach should communicate that clearly without overselling it.\n\r\n\n\r\nAn example of the register we expect:\n\r\n\n\r\n“Hi [Name], I work with a small number of private clinics on a structured 21-day implementation that reduces appointment no-shows — at no cost to the practice. We’re selective about who we invite. Would a brief conversation make sense?”\n\r\n\n\r\nNote the phrasing: “at no cost to the practice” rather than “free.” The offer is identical, but the language preserves the premium positioning. Clinic owners have seen free trials. They have not been selectively invited to a no-cost structured implementation. That distinction matters and should come through in how you write.\n\r\n\n\r\nShort. Specific. No pressure. This is the standard your outreach should meet.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nTo apply, please answer all of the following questions. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: Begin your application with the word “Structured” to confirm you have read this post in full.\n\r\n\n\r\nWrite a short LinkedIn message introducing the 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience to a private dental clinic owner. (This is the most important part of your application.)\n\r\nDescribe your B2B outreach experience — sectors, tools used, and typical volumes.\n\r\nHow would you identify and research private dental clinics in England?\n\r\nConfirm your expected monthly salary in USD.\n\r\nConfirm your weekly availability and your overlap with UK business hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nVioConcierge is a product of Smart AI Solutions. We are building something long-term and are selective about who joins the team.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Instagram Growth Owner — Creator-First Distribution | Performance-First Ownership\n\r\nFull-time (40 hrs/week) · Remote · $1,200/month + Performance Bonuses\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a calorie-and-macro-tracking app that feels like taking notes. Type what you ate in plain English (like \"eggs toast coffee\") or snap a photo and let AI estimate your calories and macros. No database rabbit holes. No friction.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur landing page: \n\r\n\n\r\nWe're hiring one person to own Instagram end-to-end with a clear bar: you must be able to produce positive ROI within 10 days.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: This is not a \"brand social\" role. It's not about Meta ad spend. This role is built around a creator-first growth system and distribution multiplication across multiple accounts.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nYou own all Instagram operations. Here's what that means:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Creator Engine (Acquisition)\n\r\n- Source creators fast: fitness, meal prep, recipes, \"what I eat,\" weight loss, gym niches\n\r\n- Negotiate performance-based deals with minimal fixed fees and clear deliverables\n\r\n- Manage quality: scripts, hooks, filming guidelines, edits, posting requirements\n\r\n- Track outcomes via codes/links; maintain a clean pipeline in Sheets, Airtable, or Notion\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Distribution Multiplication (Scaling)\n\r\n- Take winning creator content and expand reach across owned accounts + partner pages\n\r\n- Turn one winning concept into many variations: new hooks, captions, crops, CTAs\n\r\n- Operate multiple themed accounts (recipes, meal prep, gym macros, etc.) with consistent cadence\n\r\n- Stagger posts intelligently — avoid duplication spam and build compounding account trust\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Creative Iteration (Speed)\n\r\n- Ship new creatives fast: hooks, scripts, briefs, edits, re-cuts\n\r\n- Build a \"winner playbook\" — when something hits, produce 10+ variations quickly\n\r\n- Maintain a testing cadence that's relentless, measurable, and not vibes-based\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Outbound Ops (Pipeline)\n\r\n- Run IG DM and\n outreach to creators, communities, and distribution partners\n\r\n- Build repeatable templates: outreach, follow-ups, negotiation, contracts, checklists\n\r\n- Keep your tracker/CRM clean with clear statuses and next actions\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE 2 KPIs YOU'LL OWN\n\r\n\n\r\nKPI #1: Day-10 Instagram Contribution ROI (cROI)\n\r\ncROI = Instagram-attributed revenue ÷ Instagram total spend (creator costs, editing, tools, boosting if used). Target: break-even or better (cROI ? 1.0) by Day 10, then improve and scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nKPI #2: Weekly Net-New Paying Subscribers from Instagram (NNPS-IG)\n\r\nFirst-time paying subscribers attributed to Instagram via trackable links, codes, or landing pages. Target: grow week-over-week while maintaining KPI #1.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: iOS attribution is imperfect. You're expected to build measurement that's honest, consistent, and decision-useful.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE IN YOUR FIRST 10 DAYS\n\r\n\n\r\n- A creator pipeline producing consistent deal flow with negotiated terms and scheduled posts\n\r\n- 10–20 creator videos in motion (live or scheduled) with tracking links/codes\n\r\n- A functioning distribution network: multiple accounts posting variations, not identical duplicates\n\r\n- Daily reporting loop: what shipped, what performed, what's being cut, what's being scaled\n\r\n- At least one repeatable path to cROI ? 1.0 with a plan to scale without ROI collapsing\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nMust Have:\n\r\n- Proven, revenue-accountable Instagram growth experience (creators + content systems + distribution)\n\r\n- Strong fundamentals: hook writing, creative direction, offer positioning, conversion instincts\n\r\n- Comfort operating under iOS attribution constraints without lying to yourself\n\r\n- Operator mindset: you ship fast, measure honestly, iterate without a big team\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points:\n\r\n- Mobile subscription growth experience (trial-to-paid, payback windows, churn/LTV thinking)\n\r\n- UGC pipeline building (sourcing + scripting + editing workflow)\n\r\n- Multi-account content distribution without destroying trust signals\n\r\n- Strong taste in short-form content — you can feel what holds attention in the first 1–2 seconds\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Do NOT Need:\n\r\n- Prior experience with a calorie/macro app specifically\n\r\n- \"Influencer marketing\" as your only skill — this is an end-to-end growth system role\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\n- $1,200/month for ~40 hrs/week\n\r\n- Performance bonuses tied directly to ROI and subscriber growth\n\r\n- Payment via Wise (twice monthly)\n\r\n- Shape company culture and growth systems from day one\n\r\n- Collaborative Estonian team: regular syncs, high ownership, fast decisions\n\r\n- Fully remote — flexible hours with some overlap for syncs\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your application with the letter X, then answer these two questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A short note on how you'd get to positive ROI in 10 days using a creator-first distribution engine (no heavy reliance on paid ads).\n\r\n\n\r\n2. 1–2 examples of creator-led growth systems you've run. Include: what you shipped, how you tracked results, and how you scaled winners. Link to an IG account you grew or a screenshot of campaign results if you have one.                ",

We are currently searching for our very first full-time creative team member. Because you are our first hire, you will not be lost in a massive corporate machine or treated as a disposable contractor. You will work directly with the founder to shape the visual output of our company. We believe in mutual growth, absolute respect for your time, and providing a stable, long-term environment for someone who is eager to learn and grow with us.\n\nRole Overview\n\nWe are seeking a highly organized, detail-oriented Video Editor who understands the unique nuances of professional content. Your primary objective will be to take raw footage, transform it into engaging, high-retention videos, and manage the administrative scheduling of those assets across our platforms.\n\nYou will be responsible for editing two distinct categories of content:\n\n1. Client Deliverables: Polished, professional videos tailored to the specific brand guidelines of our corporate clients.\n\n2. Internal Content Marketing: Educational videos, thought leadership clips, and promotional assets designed to market our own agency.\n\nThis role requires a critical balance of creative editing and administrative precision. You will not just be cutting footage; you will be the final step in our content distribution pipeline, ensuring that the right video goes live at the right time.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\n• Edit long-form and short-form videos (both vertical and horizontal formats) utilizing Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\n• Incorporate clean, professional motion graphics, lower-thirds, and text overlays suitable for a corporate audience. (Please note: We do not use frantic, over-edited \"influencer\" styles. We value clean, authoritative pacing that builds trust).\n\n• Perform essential color correction, audio leveling, and background noise reduction to ensure high production value.\n\n• Export finalized assets optimized for the compression algorithms of various platforms (LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram).\n\n• Upload completed videos, write basic accompanying social media captions, and schedule posts for distribution using the Metricool platform.\n\n• Utilize Metricool's \"Approval Workflow\" feature to submit drafts to management for review prior to final publication.\n\n• Maintain highly organized project files, folder structures, and secure cloud backups.\n\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\n• Proven, demonstrable experience utilizing Adobe Premiere Pro (Knowledge of After Effects is a fantastic bonus, but not strictly required for this role).\n\n• A strong portfolio demonstrating your ability to edit professional, narrative-driven content (such as talking heads, explainer videos, or podcasts).\n\n• Experience with, or a strong willingness to rapidly learn, Metricool for social media scheduling and analytics.\n\n• Excellent English comprehension and written communication skills for drafting basic social media copy.\n\n• A strong understanding of pacing, storytelling, and visual hierarchy.\n\n• Exceptional attention to detail—you meticulously review your own work before submitting it for approval.\n\nHardware & Technical Requirements\n\n(Due to the heavy processing requirements of video editing, please ensure your personal workstation meets these criteria before applying)\n\n• Processor (CPU): Intel Core i7 / AMD Ryzen 7 (or equivalent/newer) / Apple Silicon M1 or newer.\n\n• Memory (RAM): Minimum 16GB (32GB is highly preferred for a smooth 4K workflow).\n\n• Graphics (GPU): Dedicated GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1660 / RTX series or equivalent) with at least 4GB VRAM.\n\n• Storage: Solid State Drive (NVMe SSD preferred) to ensure fast playback of heavy files.\n\n• Internet: A highly stable connection with a minimum of 50 Mbps Download / 20 Mbps Upload speeds (this is crucial for downloading gigabytes of raw client files).\n\n• Power: Access to a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) or backup power during regional outages is highly preferred.\n\nWhat We Offer You\n\n• A stable, full-time monthly salary paid reliably on schedule via EasyPay or your preferred transfer method.\n\n• Statutory 13th-Month Pay (prorated based on your exact start date).\n\n• A flexible, output-based working environment. As long as deadlines are strictly met and communication is clear, we do not micromanage your daily hours.\n\n• The opportunity for significant career growth. As our first creative hire, successful performance will lead to increased responsibilities, leadership opportunities, and increased compensation as the business scales.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nWe receive a high volume of applications for our roles. To ensure we are reviewing candidates who possess the high attention to detail required for professional video editing, please follow these instructions perfectly. Applications that do not follow these steps will be immediately discarded.\n\n1. Change the subject line of your application\n to exactly: \"B2B Premiere Editor\"\n\n2. Provide a brief, 3-to-4 sentence introduction explaining why you are interested in transitioning into or continuing to work within business education content editing and content marketing.\n\n3. Include a direct link to your portfolio. Please explicitly point out 1 or 2 specific videos in your portfolio that best demonstrate clean, professional pacing and excellent audio management.\n\n4. Include a direct screenshot of your computer’s system specifications (showing CPU, RAM, and GPU) alongside a screenshot of a recent internet speed test.\n\nNote to Applicants: Shortlisted candidates will be invited to complete a short, time-bound trial task. This will involve editing 60 seconds of sample footage and drafting a theoretical Metricool upload sequence to ensure we are aligned on style and technical capability. You are welcome to heavily watermark this trial task to protect your intellectual property.                ",

This is not bodycam or low-effort content, but long-form, carefully written storytelling.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a full-time, long-term position. Strong writers will always have consistent work, along with opportunities to grow within the company, take on additional responsibility, and earn higher pay over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n\n\r\nFluency in written English\n\r\nNo use of AI when writing scripts\n\r\nAbility to work with very disturbing subject matter\n\r\nA creative mindset capable of building tension and compelling narratives\n\r\n\n\r\nVideos typically range from 30 to 60 minutes or longer, with an expected turnaround time of 10 to 12 days per script.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor every script, you will be provided with a detailed research document containing most of the necessary information, allowing you to focus fully on writing rather than spending hours on independent research.

Additionally, you should be able to dedicate at least 4 to 8 hours per day to writing, as anything less will make it difficult to meet deadlines and performance expectations.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur writing style is similar to the examples linked below:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation ranges from $150 to $300 per video, depending on length.

Elite.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want someone who can do it all — direct response Meta ads that convert, viral TikToks and Reels that blow up, YouTube-style content with animations and motion graphics, AI-generated visuals, 3D renders — the full spectrum. If you're the kind of editor who makes people stop scrolling and say \"how the hell did they make that?\" — keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe day-to-day:\n\r\n• Edit direct response ads for Meta, TikTok, and paid channels — UGC-style ads, testimonial mashups, product demos, VSLs, and performance creative.\n\r\n• Create viral organic content for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts that feels native and gets shared.\n\r\n• Push creative boundaries — AI-generated content, 3D renders, custom animations, motion graphics, cinematic transitions, and anything that makes us stand out in the feed.\n\r\n• Edit longer-form YouTube-style content with professional animations and graphics.\n\r\n• Work closely with our creative strategist and copywriter — they bring the angles and scripts, you bring them to life.\n\r\n• Iterate fast — we test a lot of creative. High output without sacrificing quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nAlready experienced in direct response? Perfect — you're exactly what we need. Insanely talented but no direct response experience? That works too. If you're behind viral content racking up millions of views and can do jaw-dropping work with AI, 3D, and animation — we'll teach you direct response. You bring the talent, we'll give you the frameworks.\n\r\n\n\r\nShow Us What You've Got\n\r\nThis role is all about the work. Your application should include:\n\r\n• A portfolio or reel — show us your best edits. We want to see range: paid ads, viral content, animations, AI-generated work, 3D, motion graphics — whatever showcases your ceiling.\n\r\n• Links to any viral content you've created — TikToks, Reels, Shorts. If it blew up, we want to see it.\n\r\n• Examples of direct response or performance ads you've edited (if applicable).\n\r\n• Tools and software you use — editing, animation, AI, 3D, all of it.\n\r\n• Your availability and timezone.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for a full-time editor who becomes a core part of our creative team. If you're obsessed with editing, constantly leveling up, and want creative freedom at a brand that's scaling aggressively — we want to hear from you.                ",
