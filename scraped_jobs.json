You don't just build what you're told; you notice when something looks off and fix it\n\r\nWordPress expertise, custom theme development, ACF (Advanced Custom Fields), flexible content, custom blocks, PHP templating. You build modular, reusable components not one off sections that can't be repurposed\n\r\nPHP proficiency comfortable writing custom backend logic, not just installing plugins\n\r\nShopify Liquid comfortable with theme architecture, sections, templates\n\r\nModern CSS/SCSS responsive design, animations, transitions, grid, flexbox\n\r\nJavaScript vanilla JS, DOM manipulation, some framework experience is a plus\n\r\nServer management comfortable with hosting environments, SSH, staging setups, DNS, basic server troubleshooting\n\r\nSecurity awareness SSL, WordPress hardening, malware scanning, keeping things locked down\n\r\nGit proficiency branching, merging, pull requests, code review. Not just committing to main\n\r\nAI coding tools this is critical. We expect you to use Claude Code, Cursor, or similar AI tools daily. Not as a crutch, but as a force multiplier. If you're not already using AI in your development workflow, this isn't the right fit\n\r\nDocumentation habits you write code comments, maintain READMEs, and document architecture decisions. We never want to be in a position where only you understand how something is built\n\r\nIndependence you can take a brief, ask smart questions, and deliver without constant oversight\n\r\nAttention to detail pixel level precision on implementation.

You'll have input into how we set these up\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Standards\n\r\nWe're moving away from an external agency because their output consistently didn't meet our standards. To be direct about what that means:\n\r\n\n\r\nA page duplication with copy and image swaps should take 2–3 hours, not 20\n\r\nA loading animation should actually loop until the page is ready, not play once and show a black screen\n\r\nIf you're building ACF sections, they should be modular enough to reuse across pages without rebuilding from scratch every time\n\r\nCode should be clean, commented, documented, and structured — not 150 lines of inline CSS with no explanation\n\r\nIf something will take longer than expected, we want to know upfront with a clear explanation — not a post-hoc justification\n\r\nEvery project should have a README. Every architectural decision should be documented. We will never again be in a position where only one person or team understands how something works\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're not unreasonable. We understand complexity. But we don't accept padded hours or sloppy architecture.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Growth\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting: Part-time (30 hours/week)\n\r\nGrowth path: Full-time as revenue scales, with compensation growth to match\n\r\nLong-term: For the right person, this evolves into a technical lead role with broader architectural responsibility and compensation that reflects it\n\r\nPayment: Monthly, USD\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nDon't send a generic cover letter. Instead, send us:\n\r\nYour portfolio \n\r\nLoom video introduction\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation\n\r\nPhilippines based candidates only.                ",

This is great if you like working by yourself in the quiet, but it can be terribly painful if you need the energy of coworkers nearby.\n\r\nOur Cultural Values - We're an American company with an incredibly unusual culture. Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures. It's a great culture for people who speak directly and have a great deal of self-confidence and ownership. If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experience lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology. Secret Message - When you apply, you'll see a box that asks if you want to add anything else. Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks.

We use technology heavily to automate our operations and are looking for a smart, motivated developer to help us build and expand our automation systems.\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need a sharp, resourceful junior developer who is comfortable using AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude Code) to build real, working solutions. **You don't need to be a senior engineer.** You need to be intelligent, honest, and relentless about figuring things out.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be integrating multiple business platforms via their APIs into a centralized data system, building automation workflows, and growing into more advanced AI projects over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n**This is NOT a role for someone who wants to bill hours and drag projects out.** We want someone who takes ownership, moves fast, delivers results, and charges fairly.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n- Connect APIs (Gmail, Hostaway, OpenPhone, (Quo) \n) into a centralized data system (MCP architecture)\n\r\n- Use Claude, Claude Code, and other AI tools as your daily co-pilot to write, debug, and ship code\n\r\n- Build simple but functional automation pipelines that process data across platforms\n\r\n- Communicate progress clearly, ask good questions when stuck, and document your work\n\r\n- Grow into more advanced projects: voice AI (ElevenLabs), video AI (HeyGen), guest-facing interfaces\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n**Must-Have:**\n\r\n- High problem-solving ability — you figure things out, you don't give up easily\n\r\n- Basic comfort with Python or JavaScript (you don't need to be an expert)\n\r\n- Already using AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) to code and learn faster\n\r\n- Honest, reliable, responsive communication (we use async communication heavily)\n\r\n- You'd rather ship something that works than overthink it\n\r\n- Strong English communication skills (written)\n\r\n- Available 20-40 hours per week with consistent schedule\n\r\n\n\r\n**Nice-to-Have:**\n\r\n- Familiarity with REST APIs and webhooks\n\r\n- Experience with \n, n8n, or Zapier\n\r\n- Familiarity with Git/GitHub\n\r\n\n\r\n**What Does NOT Matter:**\n\r\n- Years of experience\n\r\n- Computer Science degree\n\r\n- Having used these specific APIs before\n\r\n- Your age (we care about ability, not credentials)\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- a posibility of  long-term part-time work with a fair employer\n\r\n- Access to Claude Pro and AI development tools (we pay for your tools)\n\r\n- Real projects that ship — not busywork\n\r\n- Opportunity to grow your skills on interesting AI/automation projects\n\r\n- Direct communication with the founder (no corporate bureaucracy)\n\r\n\n\r\n## Minimum Requirements to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**You MUST meet ALL of the following to be considered. Applications missing any of these will be ignored.**\n\r\n\n\r\n### 1. Proof of a Working Project\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must share a link to at least ONE project you have built that involves code. This can be:\n\r\n- A GitHub, GitLab, or Replit link\n\r\n- A CodePen or CodeSandbox link\n\r\n- A deployed app or website you built\n\r\n- A Google Drive link to a project folder with source code\n\r\n\n\r\nThe project does NOT need to be complex. It could be a simple automation script, a web scraper, a basic web app, a bot, a data tool — anything. But it must be real code that you wrote (with or without AI assistance), and you must be able to explain it.\n\r\n\n\r\n**No link = no consideration. No exceptions.** \n\r\n\n\r\n### 2. Demonstrate AI Tool Usage\n\r\n\n\r\nRecord a short Loom video (2-3 minutes max) showing:\n\r\n\n\r\n- You opening Claude.ai (free version is fine) or ChatGPT\n\r\n- You giving it a coding prompt related to an API integration (any API)\n\r\n- You explaining what the AI gave you, what's correct, and what you would fix or improve\n\r\n\n\r\nThis shows me you actually use AI tools and understand what the code does — not just copy-paste blindly.\n\r\n\n\r\n**No Loom video = no consideration.**\n\r\n\n\r\n### 3. Written Application Answers\n\r\n\n\r\nAnswer ALL of these questions in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n**A)** What programming language(s) are you most comfortable with? Rate yourself 1-10 for each and be honest — I respect honesty more than inflated numbers.\n\r\n\n\r\n**B)** Have you ever connected to a REST API? If yes, which one(s) and what did you do with the data? If no, that's okay — describe how you would approach it for the first time.\n\r\n\n\r\n**C)** What is your hourly rate expectation in USD? How many hours per week are you available, and what hours/time zone do you work in?\n\r\n\n\r\n**D)** Why do you want this role specifically? (2-3 sentences — I can spot copy-paste answers.)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nYour application must include,\n\r\n\n\r\nLink to at least one code project you built\n\r\nLoom video showing you using an AI coding tool (2-3 min)\n\r\nWritten answers to questions A, B, C, and D above\n\r\n\n\r\n**Incomplete applications will not be reviewed.** I know this is a lot to ask — that's intentional. If you take the time to do this, you're already ahead of 90% of applicants.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Build a Media Brand That Takes Over an Industry\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nOur company is a fast-scaling, multi-vertical property tech company redefining how people buy, sell, rent, and manage property, without agents. Our flagship platform is the first agentless real estate ecosystem, powered by automation, legal compliance, and smart systems. We have been dubbed the Uber of Real Estate\n\r\nWe’re currently in stealth mode, preparing for a national public launch. This is a rare opportunity to join at the ground level of a disruptive brand backed by years of planning, serious tech, and major ambitions.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\nWe’re looking for a high-performing, senior Social Media Manager & Content Creator to own and execute our social content strategy across Instagram, TikTok,\n, LinkedIn, Threads, and more.\n\r\nYou’ll work closely with our founder to drive brand awareness, build a cult-like following, launch viral campaigns, attract early sellers and buyers, and create content that makes agents nervous and audiences obsessed.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nPlan, create, and post daily content across IG, TikTok, FB, LinkedIn & more\n\r\nCreate and manage monthly content calendars across multiple verticals \n\r\nWrite engaging, on-brand captions with sharp hooks, clear CTAs, and platform-specific tones\n\r\nEdit reels and short-form videos (raw footage provided or repurposed from internal content)\n\r\nManage comment replies, DMs, shares, and cross-platform engagement\n\r\nIdentify and leverage trending audio, \ns, formats, and hashtags\n\r\nProduce professional visual assets\n\r\nBuild hype for competitions & campaigns\n\r\nTrack metrics, growth, engagement, and make data-backed content decisions\n\r\nExpectations\n\r\nBe proactive: Suggest and execute new ideas weekly, fortnightly & monthly, not just follow orders.\n\r\nStay up to date: Monitor trends, \ns, algorithm changes, competitor activity & report back.\n\r\nProtect the brand: Proofread everything, escalate risks, and never post off-brand content.\n\r\nBe responsive: Quick to answer, quick to adapt. Social is 24/7.\n\r\nMove fast\n\r\nMeasure & iterate: Regularly A/B test content, double down on what works.\n\r\nCollaborate: Work closely with our founder & their EA\n\r\nDocument: Maintain a living content calendar, asset library, and reporting sheet.\n\r\nThis is not a “social media job”. We’re building a media machine to support one of the most ambitious property technology launches. Our goal isn’t to “grow an Instagram page”. Our goal is to dominate attention, shape the conversation, and make our brand unavoidable.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want our social channels to feel like a media company, fast, opinionated, disciplined, creative, relentless\n\r\n\n\r\nIf your idea of social media is posting a few graphics each week and waiting for likes, this role is not for you. If you love building \nntum, spotting angles, cutting sharp videos, reacting fast, and watching content explode, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur platform has been dubbed the Uber of Real Estate. We’re launching aggressively and we expect attention, criticism & scale, and we’re building a serious media operation to match that ambition.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll actually be doing day to day\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will run our social presence, and that means:\n\r\n• planning content\n\r\n• creating content\n\r\n• editing content\n\r\n• posting content\n\r\n• reacting to what happens because of the content\n\r\n• and doing it again, faster, smarter, better\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatforms Managed\n\r\n• Instagram (posts, reels, stories)\n\r\n•\n (page, groups)\n\r\n• TikTok (videos, trends, skits)\n\r\n• YouTube (shorts, testimonials, explainer videos)\n\r\n• LinkedIn (company, founder profile)\n\r\n• Threads\n\r\n•\n/X (brand, PR, viral threads)\n\r\n• Google Business Profile (for reviews and posts)\n\r\n\n\r\nSome days you’ll be editing planned content, other days you’ll be cutting a clip or post within hours because something unexpected blew up. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role rewards people who think like editors and producers, not just schedulers.\n\r\n\n\r\nSome content is planned a month ahead, some content is created because something just happened. You need to be good at both.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we’re looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for someone who already knows what they’re doing.\n\r\nYou should have 5+ years of experience managing brand social media, not personal pages and not hobby accounts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should:\n\r\n\n\r\n• personally edit short-form video (this is non-negotiable)\n\r\n• understand hooks, pacing, subtitles, and retention\n\r\n• have taste and restraint, not just trend addiction\n\r\n• be comfortable producing 15–20 pieces of content per week\n\r\n• stay calm when comments turn negative or heated\n\r\n• enjoy fast-moving environments\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a role where someone tells you exactly what to post every day. You’re expected to have initiative & think.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter a few months, our accounts should feel like: “These guys are everywhere.”\n\r\nContent should:\n\r\n• spark discussion\n\r\n• trigger reactions\n\r\n• get shared into group chats\n\r\n• be stitched, duetted, screenshotted\n\r\n• shape how people talk about the industry\n\r\n\n\r\nIf something hits, you know how to milk it.\n\r\nIf something doesn’t, you know how to kill it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this role is exciting\n\r\nYou’re joining before the big spotlight.\n\r\nYou’ll help define:\n\r\n• how the brand sounds\n\r\n• how it moves\n\r\n• how fast it reacts\n\r\n• what it becomes known for\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn’t a short campaign or a throwaway contract.\n\r\nIf you’re good, you’ll grow with the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll apply via our Google Form where we’ll ask for:\n\r\n• proof of experience\n\r\n• examples of your video editing\n\r\n• how you think about content\n\r\n\n\r\n???? \n\r\n\n\r\nFinal note\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re building something loud, visible, and serious.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want safe, predictable work, skip this.\n\r\nIf you want to build a media engine and be proud of it, we want to hear from you.

Our brand is powered by a growing team of high-achievers who value ownership, honesty, and continuous improvement. Many of our tea\nmbers have been with us for years and grown into bigger roles. For instance, our manager started as a Virtual Assistant through OnlineJobs.ph nearly 5 years ago and has grown into her leadership role. We are committed to helping you succeed and invest in people who want to grow long-term, not just find “another online job.”\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\r\nWe are looking for a reliable, detail-oriented, and self-driven Virtual Assistant who takes pride in high-quality work. You respond quickly without needing reminders, you research questions before asking, and you enjoy finding better ways to do things. You are comfortable working with autonomy, communicating in outstanding American English, and you see this role as a chance to learn, grow, and outperform your own previous best.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role offers semi-flexible hours with weekly calls across time zones and day-to-day work done independently.\n\r\n\n\r\nCORE RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\r\n- Support daily operations across e-commerce platforms (admin tasks, customer service, simple research, documentation).\n\r\n- Manage and update spreadsheets, documents, and basic reports.\n\r\n- Follow and improve existing SOPs, documenting what you learn as you go.\n\r\n- Communicate clearly with the team in writing and on calls, sharing progress and asking smart questions when truly needed.\n\r\n- Take ownership of assigned tasks and look for small ways to improve processes and results.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\r\n- Fluency in American English: Exceptional written and verbal communication.\n\r\n- Familiarity with Microsoft Office (Word, Excel) and Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets).\n\r\n- Analytical thinking: Comfortable with basic data, simple reports, and logical problem-solving.\n\r\n- Highly organized: Strong attention to detail and ability to prioritize.\n\r\n- Self-motivated and autonomous: You set mini-deadlines, move work forward without reminders, and keep your commitments.\n\r\n- Research-first mindset: You look for answers in SOPs, past messages, and search engines before asking the team.\n\r\n- Eager to learn: You actively look for feedback, new tools, and better ways to work.\n\r\n\n\r\nDESIRED SKILLS (preferred but not required):\n\r\n- Familiarity with Amazon FBA or other e-commerce marketplaces.\n\r\n- Experience using tools like Asana, Slack, or similar project-management/communication platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nBENEFITS:\n\r\n- 100% remote work.\n\r\n- Competitive salary with opportunities for performance-based increases up to twice per year.\n\r\n- Internet bill coverage.\n\r\n- Long-term growth opportunities in a stable, fast-moving company.\n\r\n- Access to training resources and a supportive leadership team that wants you to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE ABOUT USE OF AI:\n\r\nWe actively use and encourage AI tools in our day-to-day work, and we see them as a powerful way to work smarter. However, during the hiring process we ask that you complete all application questions and exercises yourself, without AI assistance. We genuinely want to get to know the real YOU, not a \"perfectly polished, robotic answer\" you. Don’t worry about sentence structure or grammar; what matters to us is the substance of your answers and the honesty behind them. If we believe AI has been used to generate your responses, your application will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (READ CAREFULLY):\n\r\n- Use this\n subject line exactly: \"I will not use AI\"\n\r\n- At the very top of your\n body, before anything else, write this sentence exactly: \"Hello PRIMEPURE team, I pay attention to small details\"\n\r\n- In the rest of the\n body, in few short sentences, answer these two questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What would you want us to remember about you after reading 100 applications? \n\r\n2. What are your salary expectations for this position (per month in USD)?\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that do not follow these few simple instructions will sadly not be considered. If shortlisted, you’ll receive an\n from Anna with instructions on the next steps. Thank you for your time, and best of luck!                ",

The content features long-form conversations with opposing viewpoints, designed to challenge ideas and spark real dialogue.\n\r\nThe editing style here is intentional and debate-driven — not flashy vlog work. Long-form videos are structured as narratives, cutting between live stream footage and direct-to-camera storytelling to turn raw conversations into something compelling and watchable. Shorts are standalone reaction content built for fast pacing and strong hooks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe're looking for a reliable, skilled editor to deliver on a weekly basis: That can match this editing style \n and \n\r\n\n\r\n1 long-form YouTube video (30–90 min final length, approximately 8–10 hours of editing)\n\r\n2 YouTube Shorts (9:16 vertical, reaction-style content)\n\r\n\n\r\nTotal weekly commitment: roughly 10–12 hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat the Work Looks Like\n\r\nLong-form editing:\n\r\nEach video tells the story of a live stream conversation or debate. You'll receive a scripted breakdown that alternates between two formats:\n\r\n\n\r\nClips — actual stream footage of the best \nnts: high-conflict exchanges, funny beats, and decisive arguments\n\r\nStoryteller segments — direct-to-camera or voiceover sections where the host summarizes what happened, explains his thinking, or transitions the narrative forward\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to assemble these into a cohesive, fast-paced video that plays like a story with a beginning, middle, and end. That means:\n\r\n\n\r\nFollowing the provided script to cut between clip footage and storyteller segments\n\r\nKeeping pacing tight — no dead air, no filler, no redundancy between what the clips show and what the narration covers\n\r\nBalancing and cleaning up audio across both formats (stream audio and studio audio will sound different)\n\r\nApplying basic color correction\n\r\nAdding minimal, effective on-screen text where it helps the viewer follow the discussion or argument\n\r\nExporting in the correct format for YouTube\n\r\n\n\r\nShorts (reaction content):\n\r\n\n\r\nEdit green-screen and blind-react style reaction videos\n\r\nOpen with a strong hook\n\r\nClearly frame the argument or \nnt of tension\n\r\nMatch the existing Big Jon Steel Shorts style\n\r\nOptimize for engagement and fast pacing\n\r\n\n\r\nGeneral expectations:\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunicate clearly and hit weekly deadlines\n\r\nHandle reasonable revisions when needed\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills\n\r\n\n\r\nProficiency in Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or DaVinci Resolve\n\r\nExperience editing debate, talking-head, or podcast-style content\n\r\nStrong sense of YouTube pacing and retention\n\r\nAbility to identify standout debate \nnts worth clipping\n\r\nComfortable working through long-form, audio-heavy footage\n\r\nReliable communication and consistent delivery\n\r\n\n\r\nStrongly Preferred\n\r\n\n\r\nFamiliarity with Christian apologetics, religious debates, or culture-war content\n\r\nExperience editing clips meant to provoke discussion or response\n\r\nUnderstanding of how Shorts function differently from long-form content\n\r\nWillingness to follow an established style rather than reinvent it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Deliverables\n\r\n\n\r\n1 fully edited, upload-ready long-form video\n\r\n2 Shorts (9:16), reaction-style, matching current channel style\n\r\nClean exports and project files if requested\n\r\nRevisions as needed, communicated clearly on both sides\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\nOpen to per-video, weekly flat rate, or hourly arrangements. Please include your preferred rate when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend the following:\n\r\n\n\r\nLinks to relevant editing work — especially debate, podcast, or discussion content, we will only be responding to people with a portfolio containing videos you have edited\n\r\nPLEASE\n PORTFOLIO TO: \n\r\nA brief summary of your experience with YouTube editing\n\r\nThe software you use\n\r\nYour rate and availability\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Matters\n\r\nThis channel engages real conversations about faith, culture, and truth. The editing isn't just technical work — it directly shapes how arguments are understood, received, and shared.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About the Role\n\r\nWe run a US-based luxury hospitality portfolio — currently 3–6 short-term rental properties and a boutique micro-wedding venue. We're looking for an Operations Manager, not a Virtual Assistant.\n\r\nWe run a modern, tech-forward operation — we use a lot of tools, build custom systems, and lean on AI to work smarter. You don't need to be an engineer, but you do need to be the kind of person who picks up new software quickly and genuinely enjoys finding better ways to do things.\n\r\nThis role is the \"Control Tower\" of our business. You will own logistics, guest experience, wedding sales, and brand marketing simultaneously — solving problems, spending company money when needed, and making judgment calls without waiting on the owner. If you need to be told what to do every hour, this is not the right fit. If you thrive with real ownership and a direct line to leadership, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Own\n\r\n1. Logistics & Procurement\n\r\nYou are responsible for ensuring our properties never run out of supplies. You'll manage inventory across all locations, use the company card to reorder linens, toiletries, and consumables proactively, and maintain accurate stock logs. You own this — not us.\n\r\nCleaner & Contractor Oversight: You are the direct supervisor for our cleaning teams. You'll set schedules, review photo quality reports after each turnover, and approve payments. If something breaks — a heater, a lock, an appliance — you troubleshoot with the guest, source and hire a local contractor, authorize payment, and then notify the owner once it's resolved.\n\r\n2. Wedding Venue Sales & Coordination\n\r\nOur systems are set up to help you respond to inbound wedding inquiries within 5 minutes during your shift — and that standard is non-negotiable. You'll answer questions about pricing, capacity, and availability with a warm, white-glove tone that matches the caliber of our venue. You'll qualify leads, schedule on-site tours, and keep our CRM (HoneyBook/Dubsado) clean and up to date so no lead falls through the cracks.\n\r\n3. Guest Experience — Short-Term Rentals\n\r\nOwn all guest communication from inquiry to checkout across Airbnb and VRBO. Handle escalations, disputes with platform support, and craft professional responses to reviews — both positive and negative.\n\r\n4. Content & Marketing \n\r\nThis is a real part of the job, not an afterthought. You'll be responsible for:\n\r\n- Social media posting and scheduling across Instagram,\n, and TikTok using our content calendar and tools (e.g., Later, Buffer, or similar)\n\r\n- Marketing\n execution — sending pre-written or lightly templated campaigns to our lead lists via our\n platform (e.g., Mailchimp, Klaviyo, or similar)\n\r\n- Keeping our pipeline warm — following up with cold leads, past inquirers, and potential repeat guests using pre-approved messaging\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won't be writing strategy from scratch, but you need strong written English and an eye for what looks and sounds premium.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 3+ years of experience in operations, property management, event coordination, or a hybrid hospitality/marketing role\n\r\n- Must be available to work full-time, Monday–Friday, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM CST (US Central Time) — this is a hard requirement, no  exceptions\n\r\n- Prior experience handling company expenses, purchasing, or petty cash — you will be trusted with a company card\n\r\n- Fluent English communication, both written and spoken — you will be on calls with guests, wedding couples, and vendors regularly and must be able to represent the brand with confidence and warmth\n\r\n- Solid working knowledge of Google Drive, Sheets, and Docs as a daily operating environment\n\r\n- Comfortable with a tools-heavy workflow — you'll use multiple platforms simultaneously and are expected to learn new software quickly, including tools that are custom-built for our operation\n\r\n- At least passing familiarity with Slack, a CRM platform (HoneyBook, Dubsado, or similar), a social media scheduling tool (Later, Buffer, or similar), and Airbnb/VRBO host dashboards\n\r\n- Open to using AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude as part of your day-to-day — we'll show you how we use them, but curiosity beats credentials here\n\r\n- High emotional intelligence — you can de-escalate a frustrated guest and keep an anxious bride feeling taken care of, all in the same afternoon\n\r\n- Strong written English with a warm, professional tone that reflects a premium brand\n\r\nPlatform experience with Ownerrez is a strong plus but not required — we'll train the right person\n\r\n\n\r\nHardware Requirements: Reliable PC or Mac, 25 Mbps+ internet connection, Noise-canceling headset (required for guest and vendor calls)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role\n\r\nOur last ops hire treated this like a task queue. We need someone who treats it like a business they co-own. As we add properties — and we are actively acquiring — your scope and compensation grow with us. This is a long-term career position with a direct relationship with the owner, not a seat in a call center.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nApplications that don't follow these instructions will not be reviewed — this is your first test of attention to detail.\n\r\nSend an\n with the subject line: Hospitality Ops Manager – [Your Name]\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n1. Your resume or portfolio link.\n\r\n2. Written answers to both scenarios below:\n\r\nScenario A — The Inventory Problem: You review a cleaner's post-checkout report and notice one of our properties has 2 rolls of toilet paper left. A guest checks in tomorrow. Next-day delivery isn't available and the owner is unreachable. What do you do, step by step?\n\r\nScenario B — The Wedding Inquiry: A bride\ns asking to tour the venue this Saturday at 2 PM. Your calendar shows a private event in progress at that time. Write the actual reply you'd send her — it must decline that slot while keeping her warm and moving toward a booking.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Requirements: Executive Assistant (Personal) Virtual\n\r\nRequired Schedule: Monday to Saturday - 9am to 7pm. \n\r\nType: Full Time (No to multiple clients (Juggling).\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking for Male Virtual Assistant only. (No discrimination intended, just a preference based on my workflow). \n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ME:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. I am Half Japanese and half Filipino. I speak fluent Tagalog and English. However, I easily adjust to who I talk to. It is important to know, though, that Reading and writing in English are both separate skills. More on that later on. We can communicate in Tagalog or English. Usually, I prefer proper English.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. I am a workaholic. My schedule is hectic, and I have many responsibilities. My current assistant will leave after three years of working with me to pursue her path. She has been excellent in fulfilling her duties and responsibilities. I also found her here on this platform. \n\r\n\n\r\n3. Time is very important to me. I want to add more time and reduce my workload. I want to spend more time with my family when I go home every day. Most of the tasks are personally related. Task-intensive, yes, because there are a lot of small tasks like calls, messages, and research. I value the time that much. I don't want to get sidelined and distracted with my day to day tasks. \n\r\n\n\r\n4. I am a technology-oriented person. You will be introduced to many tools you have probably not heard of before (win-win). Security is another factor. I will try our relationship first before introducing myself further.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. I am more available at night after a busy day's work. I am still trying to assess our workflow. It is more of a let's see what works, and let us communicate properly on how you want things. Usually, I would reply in the morning, and of course reply during the day if a concern is there but if we come to an arrangement wherein we can review the day or plan the next tasks after 7pm or if you are still awake by 10pm then that would be really good.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Since I am busy, I can be flexible. Maybe there will be some weekdays when I won't need you, but the payment is fixed. \n\r\n\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am not sure if my job description is really the industry standard, but what I can say is I do not need a highly skilled VA in terms of Wordpress or Marketing. I want someone who is very good with Research and Communication. This is just a heads-up before moving to the next points.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUISITES:\n\r\n1. Proper English (Reading & Writing)\n\r\n2. Mobile Phone (I will provide your own, postpaid number & etc). \n\r\n3. Laptop or Desktop PC (I will provide your own)\n\r\n4. Speed Test of your internet ( I will assess this)\n\r\n5. Typing Test (Words per minute, I use Type Racer)\n\r\n5. Good Communication Skills (This is just my preference, but if you communicate with (....Hello po) and like that, I will ask you to change and improve on that part. Proper punctuation, spelling, and sentence construction will be appreciated.)\n\r\n6. Good Logic and Analytical Skills\n\r\n7. Reading between the lines. (Context of Clues)\n\r\n8. Advance notice is critical to me. I plan my tasks obsessively and schedule my life based on Time. As mentioned, I treat it like I treat it with money.\n\r\n9. Loyalty and Trust.\n\r\n10. I hope you don't mind me messaging you early in the morning or very late at night (mute it) since there are times that I create messages or instructions at these times.\n\r\n11. It would be a plus BUT NOT MANDATORY if you are in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone)\n\r\n\n\r\nMAJOR JOB DESCRIPTION:\n\r\n1. Monitors and Updates my purchases.\n\r\n2. Set Appointments (Meetings, Doctors, and other scheduled activities).\n\r\n3. Manage my purchases, inquiries, research, returns, and everything included.\n\r\n4. Purchase on my behalf (I am still researching how to authorize purchases without actually giving out my personal credit card information)\n\r\n5. Research (Must be excellent). For example: Give me a list of Five-star restaurants, etc.\n\r\n\n\r\nMINOR:\n\r\n1. Writing\n\r\n2. Compilation of Articles (Connected to Research)\n\r\n3. Contact this person on behalf of me.\n\r\n4. Transcribing\n\r\n\n\r\nBENEFITS & INCLUSIONS:\n\r\n1. Payroll will be done weekly every Friday. \n\r\n2. Of course, overtime will be paid.\n\r\n3. I'll give you all the tools with licenses and everything for you to do your work. As mentioned, I value time with the same value as money.\n\r\n4. I will give you YouTube Premium and Spotify if you want.\n\r\n5. Training and guidance will be provided.\n\r\n6. If we are successful for months and have established trust with our partnership, I will provide you with equipment such as a Laptop or Desktop, Webcam, and headset.\n\r\n8. I am willing to teach and train. We are both investing (Win-win)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTOOLS:\n\r\n- I am a very technical person. All software, tools needed will be provided. Here are some of the tools that are usually part of my toolbox. This doesn't mean that you will use all of these tools. Just wanted to lay it out there just in case you are familiar. I will be putting a (#) hashtag after a number if it is a major requirement. Expect to be assessed on these things if you are familiar.\n\r\n\n\r\nOFFICE SUITES:\n\r\n1. Google Workspace (Chrome, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Gmail)\n\r\n2. Office 365 (Edge, Word, Excel, Powerpoint)\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION TOOLS:\n\r\n1. Slack\n\r\n2. Zoom\n\r\n3.\n\r\n4.

We're a small, fast-moving team that punches well above its weight, and we're building one of the most complete ecosystems in the AI agency space.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur founder creates a high volume of raw content (on-camera video, screen recordings, ad scripts, educational content). What we're missing is the creative engine that turns that raw material into polished, scroll-stopping content across every platform we operate on.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's where you come in.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Role\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the creative engine. You take raw footage, scripts, and ideas from the founder and turn them into finished assets — ads, YouTube videos, Reels, Shorts, thumbnails, statics. A separate performance marketer handles strategy, metrics, and ad account management. Your job is to make the content look incredible and produce it at volume.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll own the full creative pipeline from raw footage to finished asset, and you'll work closely with the founder to stay 30 days ahead on the content calendar at all times.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a hands-on role where you'll be trained directly by the founder over time — not just on editing technique, but on the brand voice, audience, and what makes content connect in this space. The goal is to develop you into someone who creates with intention, not just speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Growth path:** As Echosetter scales, this role has direct scope to grow into a Creative Lead position, managing a team of editors who produce content for both Echosetter and our clients' agencies. You'd be building the department, not just filling a seat.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n### Video Editing (Paid Ads)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Edit direct-response Meta ad creatives (UGC-style, talking head, testimonial compilations, B-roll overlays)\n\r\n- Produce multiple distinct creative variations per campaign — not just different hooks on the same edit, but genuinely different visual treatments, pacing, and structures. You'll be briefed on what's needed and your job is to deliver creative diversity at volume\n\r\n- Create compelling static ad images and carousel assets\n\r\n- Use AI tools like Kling AI for face swapping and synthetic video generation to expand creative output\n\r\n- Turn around iterations quickly when the performance team requests new variations or tweaks to winning creatives\n\r\n\n\r\n### Video Editing (Organic)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Edit long-form YouTube videos (educational/value-driven content, 8–20 min)\n\r\n- Create original short-form content for Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts — this is not just cutting clips from long-form. Short-form often requires its own visual approach, pacing, and hooks. You need to understand what works natively on short-form platforms and create accordingly\n\r\n- Repurpose long-form footage into short-form where appropriate, but know the difference between a lazy chop and a purpose-built short\n\r\n- Add captions, motion graphics, transitions, and visual hooks optimized for each platform\n\r\n\n\r\n### Content Management & Scheduling\n\r\n\n\r\n- Own the content calendar across Instagram, YouTube, YouTube Shorts, and\n\r\n- Batch-create and schedule content to maintain a 30-day content buffer\n\r\n- Maintain cadence: 1–2 short-form posts/day on IG and YT Shorts, plus 3 long-form YouTube videos per week\n\r\n\n\r\n### Creative & AI-Assisted Design\n\r\n\n\r\n- Design thumbnails, social graphics, and ad statics that drive clicks\n\r\n- Use AI image and video generation tools (ChatGPT/DALL-E, Midjourney, Higgsfield, Kling AI, or similar) for creative concepting, face swapping, and visual asset production\n\r\n- Stay current with emerging AI creative tools and integrate them into your workflow — the landscape moves fast and we expect you to move with it\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n### Must-Haves\n\r\n\n\r\n- 2+ years of experience editing short-form and long-form video content for social media\n\r\n- Strong portfolio showing ad creatives, YouTube videos, and/or Reels you've produced\n\r\n- Proficiency in CapCut, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or equivalent editing tools\n\r\n- Experience creating direct-response ad creatives (you understand the visual language of ads that stop the scroll)\n\r\n- Ability to produce genuinely distinct creative variations — different looks, different energy, not just the same edit with a new intro\n\r\n- Eye for design: you can create clean, high-converting static images and thumbnails\n\r\n- Comfortable working with AI tools (Kling AI, Higgsfield, ChatGPT image gen, or similar) for creative production\n\r\n- Excellent attention to detail, self-motivated, and comfortable working autonomously in a remote setup\n\r\n- Reliable internet connection and ability to overlap with US/AU business hours for async communication\n\r\n\n\r\n### Nice-to-Haves\n\r\n\n\r\n- Previous experience working with a SaaS or B2B company\n\r\n- Experience with GoHighLevel, agency/marketing content, or the AI automation space\n\r\n- Experience with Kling AI face swapping or Runway for synthetic video generation\n\r\n- Basic motion graphics or After Effects skills\n\r\n- Experience working with a founder-led brand where you're the sole creative\n\r\n- Any experience managing or mentoring junior editors\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n*Short-form content includes both repurposed clips from long-form AND original standalone pieces. The goal is to stay 30 days ahead on the content calendar at all times through batch creation.*\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Why This Role Matters\n\r\n\n\r\nOur tech infrastructure is built. Our fulfillment engine is running. Our sales systems work. But the content engine — the thing that feeds every channel, builds the brand, and creates trust at scale — is the missing piece.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won't be buried in a team of 20 editors. You'll be THE creative engine for the entire company, working directly with the founder, with real ownership over the visual identity and content output. And as we grow, you'll have the opportunity to build and lead the creative team that produces content not just for Echosetter, but for the agencies we serve.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Tools We Use\n\r\n\n\r\nCapCut Pro, Claude (AI), Higgsfield (AI video/image gen), Slack (internal communication)\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond these, we're tool-agnostic. If there's software that makes you faster or better — Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Kling AI, Midjourney, Runway, Canva, After Effects, whatever — we'll get it. You tell us what you need to do your best work.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSend us:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Your portfolio or reel showing ad creatives, YouTube edits, and/or short-form content you've produced\n\r\n- A short Loom video (2–3 min) introducing yourself and walking through one piece of work you're proud of\n\r\n- Links to any social accounts or YouTube channels you've managed\n\r\n- Bonus: show us an example of something you created using AI tools (Kling AI, Midjourney, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\n**We move fast. If you're the right fit, you'll know within a week.**                ",

This role combines guest relations, reservation management, and administrative tasks to ensure seamless service and operational accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n- This is NOT a generic support role.\n\r\n- You’ll be juggling guests, cleaners, and maintenance teams in real time — often with imperfect information and real consequences if poor decisions are made. Because of that, our hiring process is intentionally more challenging than a typical “message responder” position.\n\r\n- The assessment you’re about to take is designed to understand how you think — how you prioritize, communicate, and make judgment calls when there isn’t one obvious right answer.\n\r\n- If you enjoy solving realistic scenarios, thinking critically, and taking ownership, you will likely enjoy both this assessment and the job itself. If you are looking for a simple, scripted support role, this probably won’t be the right fit — and that’s okay.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\nGuest Communications & Support\n\r\n- Respond promptly and professionally to booking inquiries, guest messages, and support requests across multiple platforms.\n\r\n- Provide phone support to address urgent guest needs and ensure timely issue resolution.\n\r\n- Collaborate with the operations team to facilitate smooth check-ins, check-outs, and overall guest satisfaction.\n\r\n\n\r\nOperational & Administrative Support\n\r\n- Perform booking cleanup, ensuring reservations are accurate and conflicts are resolved.\n\r\n- Conduct guest cleanup by maintaining accurate records and organizing guest profiles.\n\r\n- Manage listing accuracy and resolve platform-related issues across Airbnb, \n, Expedia, etc.\n\r\n- Support accounting functions, including expense tracking, invoice updates, and discrepancy reporting.\n\r\n- Assist in lead management, including organizing, qualifying, and supporting follow-up efforts for potential property acquisition opportunities.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n- Experience with short-term rental platforms (Airbnb, \n, Vrbo, etc.).\n\r\n- Strong communication skills and professional phone etiquette.\n\r\n- Detail-oriented with strong organizational abilities.\n\r\n-Tech-savvy and able to work independently during overnight shifts.\n\r\n- PREFERRED: Experience with PriceLabs, Beds24, accounting tasks, or lead management.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nUpload your resume here >>> \n/s/5sal0p7n                ",

We are a premier marketing agency serving the U.S. Collision Repair (Body Shop) industry. We help shop owners tough, busy entrepreneurs, get more crashed cars into their shops.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur owner, Shah, is the only salesperson. We have a high-tech system in place where leads from various avenues are automatically prompted to schedule an appointment. Your job is the human safety net.

Your cadence, slang, and tone must be indistinguishable from a native North American speaker.

If you have a \"call center\" accent, do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Intensity: You will be on the phone and in GoHighLevel all day.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Responsibility: You are the gatekeeper of Shah’s calendar.

This is not a traditional support role — you'll blend daily ticket work with project work that shapes the business using modern AI-driven workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n—\n\r\n\n\r\n[1] About the Company\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a women-led sexual wellness and intimate health brand, redefining how women experience pleasure, confidence, and comfort.

This role combines guest relations, reservation management, and administrative tasks to ensure seamless service and operational accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n- This is NOT a generic support role.\n\r\n- You’ll be juggling guests, cleaners, and maintenance teams in real time — often with imperfect information and real consequences if poor decisions are made. Because of that, our hiring process is intentionally more challenging than a typical “message responder” position.\n\r\n- The assessment you’re about to take is designed to understand how you think — how you prioritize, communicate, and make judgment calls when there isn’t one obvious right answer.\n\r\n- If you enjoy solving realistic scenarios, thinking critically, and taking ownership, you will likely enjoy both this assessment and the job itself. If you are looking for a simple, scripted support role, this probably won’t be the right fit — and that’s okay.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\nGuest Communications & Support\n\r\n- Respond promptly and professionally to booking inquiries, guest messages, and support requests across multiple platforms.\n\r\n- Provide phone support to address urgent guest needs and ensure timely issue resolution.\n\r\n- Collaborate with the operations team to facilitate smooth check-ins, check-outs, and overall guest satisfaction.\n\r\n\n\r\nOperational & Administrative Support\n\r\n- Perform booking cleanup, ensuring reservations are accurate and conflicts are resolved.\n\r\n- Conduct guest cleanup by maintaining accurate records and organizing guest profiles.\n\r\n- Manage listing accuracy and resolve platform-related issues across Airbnb, \n, Expedia, etc.\n\r\n- Support accounting functions, including expense tracking, invoice updates, and discrepancy reporting.\n\r\n- Assist in lead management, including organizing, qualifying, and supporting follow-up efforts for potential property acquisition opportunities.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n- Experience with short-term rental platforms (Airbnb, \n, Vrbo, etc.).\n\r\n- Strong communication skills and professional phone etiquette.\n\r\n- Detail-oriented with strong organizational abilities.\n\r\n-Tech-savvy and able to work independently during overnight shifts.\n\r\n- PREFERRED: Experience with PriceLabs, Beds24, accounting tasks, or lead management.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nUpload your resume here >>> \n/s/5sal0p7n                ",
