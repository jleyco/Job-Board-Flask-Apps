The Operations Assistant acts as an extension of the COO — taking loosely defined problems, determining what needs to be done, and driving them to completion with minimal supervision. This is not a task-taking role. It is an ownership role. You will be expected to operate independently, manage ambiguity, and close operational loops without constant direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\nOperational Execution & Ownership\n\r\n\n\r\nTake ownership of operational tasks delegated by the COO and execute them end-to-end. Translate high-level or loosely defined requests into clear actions. Anticipate dependencies, blockers, and follow-ups without being prompted.\n\r\nClose loops and confirm completion rather than leaving tasks half-done.\n\r\n\n\r\nAccounts, Counterparties & Exchanges\n\r\nOpen and manage accounts with exchanges, custodians, banks, brokers, and service providers. Coordinate onboarding documentation, KYC, KYB, and account setup. Track onboarding status, outstanding items, access credentials, and approvals.\n\r\nMaintain a clear inventory of active counterparties and access points.\n\r\n\n\r\nKYC & Compliance Operations\n\r\nTrack KYC refresh requirements across exchanges, counterparties, and vendors. Proactively manage document updates, renewals, and submissions. Maintain structured, up-to-date repositories of corporate and personal KYC materials.\n\r\nEnsure KYC records are complete, consistent, and audit-ready.\n\r\n\n\r\nBoard & Governance Operations\n\r\nSupport post-board and committee meeting execution and follow-through. Maintain a centralized board action log covering actions, owners, deadlines, and status. Chase internal and external stakeholders for overdue actions where appropriate.\n\r\nPrepare clean post-meeting summaries highlighting open actions and next steps. Ensure board materials, minutes, resolutions, and action trackers are correctly filed, versioned, and accessible. Keep governance records organized and inspection-ready.\n\r\n\n\r\nInvestor & External Requests (Light Touch)\n\r\nSupport responses to routine investor or counterparty queries. Gather data, documents, and supporting materials as requested. Escalate matters requiring judgment, decisions, or approvals.\n\r\n\n\r\nData, Documentation & Systems Hygiene\n\r\nOrganize, clean, and maintain Google Drive and internal document repositories. Digitize and streamline operational documentation  Enforce consistent naming, version control, and folder structures. Ensure critical documents are easy to locate and clearly labeled.\n\r\n\n\r\nProcess Improvement & Automation\n\r\nIdentify inefficient, manual, or repetitive operational processes. Propose and implement improvements using automation or workflow tools where appropriate. Create simple SOPs, checklists, or trackers once processes stabilize.\n\r\nImprove operational clarity and reduce dependency on ad-hoc explanations.\n\r\n\n\r\nAd-hoc COO Support\n\r\nPull data, prepare summaries, and assist with operational analysis. Support one-off operational projects as they arise.\n\r\nHandle frequent context switching without losing accuracy or follow-through. \n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Skills\n\r\n3+ years in operations, administration, or execution-focused roles. Experience working in fast-moving, loosely structured environments. Comfortable interacting with financial institutions, exchanges, and service providers.\n\r\nStrong written English and clear, concise communication. Highly organized with strong attention to detail.\n\r\nConfident using tools such as Google Drive, spreadsheets, and workflow tools. Able to work independently and manage competing priorities.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrongly Preferred\n\r\nExperience in hedge funds, crypto, fintech, or financial services. Prior remote or offshore role supporting senior management. Familiarity with KYC / KYB processes. Experience maintaining governance or compliance documentation.                ",

Each country has e.g. some 100 counties, and like 100 professions. So one country alone would be like doing the same task 10 thousand times. \n\r\nTherefore - you are in charge of creating, maintaining and enhancing the automation system.\n\r\n- Look, this is simplified example, but: Go ahead, try to GPT something like: \"electricians in Davao\". GPT refuses giving you all e.g. 200 of them at once. It gives you some 10, then another 10, etc. And since we will need all kinds of others, like hair dressers, plumbers, etc etc, in many different cities - its impossible to create manually. And thats what u are here for.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\r\nIntelligence. Once you got that - you can use GPT or Gemini to find out ways how to solve problems.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPayout every Friday in PHP or crypto.\n\r\nMore simple tasks follow, depending on your skills.\n\r\n\n\r\nPros: Junior position, hired in a day, opportunity to get a long-term job and being the company integral part in systems development or other departments.\n\r\nCons: We are on a tight budget.\n\r\n\n\r\nMore info?\n\r\nDont send CVs or the generic fluff you are sending to everyone.\n\r\nEither mention something very related to this job or\n us empty message at: \n will get you the details immediately.

There is no \"max\" earning with this role- the more experience, accuracy, effort, and drive you have, the more you will earn. \n\r\n\n\r\nHi!!! My name is Mel, and I own the top Christian speed-dating services in the United States! I’m on the lookout for a new assistant to grow with me. There are countless opportunities for growth, and I’m so excited to find the right person to join the team. I currently have two AMAZING assistants and need a third to keep up with the growth we've been experiencing. Here's a testimonial from one of my assistants:\n\r\n\n\r\n\"I’ve been working as Mel's VA since September 2024, and I genuinely love it. The work is meaningful (helping people find their Godly spouses), fast-paced, and never boring. You’re supporting a business that’s actively scaling. Mel is professional, clear, and respectful of boundaries. I can fully enjoy my days off, travel when needed, and never worry about work piling up. She also pays weekly and always on time. That said, a great client is great for a reason. This role requires great - truly GREAT - attention to detail. Mel has high standards, and rightfully so. If you’re not detail-oriented, proactive, and committed to doing excellent work, this won’t be the right fit. But if you are, working with her is incredibly fulfilling. I’m grateful to be part of her team and to support a leader who is clear, mission-driven, and genuinely good to work with.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease read carefully before applying\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not creative, not social-media strategy, and not “wing-it” work.\n\r\nThis role is for someone who genuinely enjoys:\n\r\n• Following detailed SOPs\n\r\n• Working from templates\n\r\n• Tracking numbers\n\r\n• Executing conditional logic accurately\n\r\n• Catching mistakes before they happen\n\r\n• Doing important but sometimes tedious admin work extremely well\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are not naturally obsessive about details, this role will feel overwhelming.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run highly organized, multi-city events with complex ticket logic, conditional\n workflows, and time-sensitive admin tasks. One small mistake can create downstream issues, so precision matters. You will be responsible for executing systems exactly as documented, while also helping improve them over time once you fully understand how everything works. This is a self-directed remote role with clear expectations, clear SOPs, and recurring tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nAdmin & Operations (High Attention to Detail)\n\r\n• Perform data entry and tracking using Google Sheets and internal spreadsheets\n\r\n• Monitor ticket inventory levels across:\n\r\n• Men’s tickets\n\r\n• Women’s tickets\n\r\n• 1-man + 1-woman tickets\n\r\n• 2-men combo tickets\n\r\n• 3-men combo tickets\n\r\n• Ensure events stay balanced (e.g., targeting 15 men / 17 women)\n\r\n• Flag issues immediately if numbers are off or approaching limits\n\r\n\n\r\nThis requires comfort with multi-variable tracking and checking numbers multiple times per day. I’m ideally looking for someone with a high \"C\" & high \"S\" in the DISC Assessment (please write out your DISC Assessment scores).\n\r\n\n\r\nConditional & Logic-Based Tasks\n\r\n• Execute conditional logic workflows (if-then scenarios), such as:\n\r\n• Sending different\ns to men vs women based on ticket availability\n\r\n• Triggering follow-ups based on survey responses\n\r\n• Knowing which template to use based on status, timing, and inventory levels\n\r\n• Ensure the correct message goes to the correct group at the correct time\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Media (Execution Only- No Strategy Required)\n\r\n• Post Instagram Stories from pre-made templates\n\r\n• Schedule stories using Buffer\n\r\n• Follow exact posting instructions (timing, captions, tagging)\n\r\n• No content creation or creativity required — execution only\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity & Event Setup\n\r\n• Create\n Events\n\r\n• Post pre-scripted messages into\n groups\n\r\n• Follow posting rules and instructions exactly\n\r\n\n\r\n & Review Follow-Ups\n\r\n• Send follow-up\ns to participants who complete post-event surveys\n\r\n• Encourage Google Reviews using approved scripts\n\r\n• Ensure\ns are sent only to the correct segments\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You Must Be Comfortable Using\n\r\n• ClickUp (task management required)\n\r\n• Google Workspace\n\r\n• Google Docs\n\r\n• Google Sheets (must be comfortable with complex spreadsheets)\n\r\n• Instagram (Stories posting + scheduling)\n\r\n• Buffer (or willingness to learn quickly)\n\r\n• ChatGPT (for problem-solving, clarification, and drafting)\n\r\n• Zapier experience is a BIG plus (not required but highly preferred)\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule & Availability Requirements\n\r\n• Remote\n\r\n• U.S. work hours strongly preferred\n\r\n• Must be able to check ticket levels morning and evening (U.S. time)\n\r\n• Weekend availability required 1-3hrs in the morning & evening on saturday & sunday.

You may opt to work 6 days instead of 5 if you prefer shorter daily hours—I’m flexible- as long as you get time-sensitive tasks finished. Some tasks will be time sensitive, others are flexible.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours & Growth\n\r\n• Start at 25–30 hours/week guaranteed, and then ramp into full-time\n\r\n• Workload will grow as we:\n\r\n• Add more cities\n\r\n• Launch new projects\n\r\n• Expand operations\n\r\n• We intentionally do not overload you at the start so there’s room to grow\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are (This Is Important)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n• Is extremely detail-oriented (double-checks everything)\n\r\n• Enjoys systems, structure, and checklists\n\r\n• Can follow SOPs without improvising\n\r\n• Notices inconsistencies others miss\n\r\n• Is fast and accurate\n\r\n• Can work independently without constant reminders\n\r\n• Enjoys improving systems after mastering them\n\r\n• Is comfortable with repetitive but important work\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a good fit if you:\n\r\n• Prefer creative work\n\r\n• Dislike repetition\n\r\n• “Skim” instructions\n\r\n• Get bored easily with admin tasks\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Benefits\n\r\n• Competitive hourly rate (based on experience)\n\r\n• 13th-month pay\n\r\n• Birthday bonus\n\r\n• Unpaid holidays allowed with advance notice (approval required for coverage)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe strongly reward:\n\r\n• Reliability\n\r\n• Accuracy\n\r\n• Initiative\n\r\n• Trustworthiness\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Promise\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are building a long-term team.

Deals you start in Q1 2026 might close in Q3 2027.\n\n\n\nKey challenges: Seasonal buying patterns (summer dead, Q2/Q4 busy). Multiple stakeholders (teachers, admins, IT, procurement—one \"no\" kills deals). Budget constraints (restricted/grant-funded). Risk aversion (schools want proof, references, pilots).\n\n\n\nYour success depends on: Building resilient AEs who understand long cycles, creating 6-18 month nurture sequences, understanding education procurement, qualifying ruthlessly, building pipeline 3-4x quota, leveraging HubSpot automation for consistent touchpoints.\n\n\n\nThis isn't transactional SaaS. If you need quick wins, this isn't the right role.\n\n\n\nSuccess Timeline\n\n\n\nMonths 1-2: 50-70 dials/day learning product/market. Close 1-2 deals, hire first AE, build playbook, set up HubSpot.\n\n\n\nMonths 3-6: 30-40 dials/day as player-coach. Team of 1-2 AEs ramping. 50% selling, 50% coaching.\n\n\n\nMonths 6-12: 20-30 dials/day. Team of 3 AEs hitting 6-9 deals/month total. Focus on coaching, strategy, complex deals.\n\n\n\nCompensation\n\n\n\n- Base: $1,200-1,600/month USD\n\n- Commission: 8% on personal deals + 2% team override - average deal size is ~$10,000\n\n- Team bonus when hitting targets\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\nMust Have:\n\n- Focused on making money, be \"coin operated\"\n\n- 3+ years B2B sales, 1+ year sales leadership\n\n- Track record closing $5K-50K deals\n\n- Strong prospecting skills—quality over quantity\n\n- Results-driven mindset—success measured by revenue, not activity metrics\n\n- Proven ability managing 6+ month sales cycles\n\n- Hands-on HubSpot CRM experience—building pipelines, sequences, automation, reports\n\n- Exceptional English (native/near-native fluency required) - daily calls with US school administrators who must easily understand you. Clear, professional pronunciation essential.\n\n- Self-directed and entrepreneurial\n\n- Patience for 12-18 month cycles\n\n\n\nStrongly Preferred:\n\n- Experience selling to schools/universities\n\n- Understanding of education procurement\n\n- EdTech, SaaS, or subscription sales background\n\n- HubSpot Sales Hub Professional/Enterprise experience\n\n\n\nWhat matters: We track activity but evaluate on outcomes. \"I made 70 dials but got no conversations\" is a problem to solve, not success. Smart targeting beats brute force. Your success = team's success.\n\n\n\nInterview includes: live video call with mock pitch, role-play with objections, demonstrating clear explanations to non-technical audiences.\n\n\n\nTo Apply\n\n\n\nSubmit:\n\n1. Resume/CV\n\n2. Brief explanation (200-300 words) of a sales process/playbook you've built—situation, what you created, results\n\n3. Answer: \"What's the biggest mistake sales teams make selling to schools with long buying cycles? How would you avoid it?\"\n\n4. 2-3 minute video introduction explaining why you're interested and your relevant experience\n\n5. Describe your HubSpot experience with specific examples\n\n\n\nWhy This Role Matters\n\n\n\nYou'll build the foundation of our sales organization. The processes you create, people you hire, and culture you establish will shape our growth for years. If you want impact, and the chance to build something from scratch in a challenging but rewarding market, this is it.\n\n\n\nThe right person understands that slow and steady wins in education sales. You'll be building a machine designed for the long game, not quick hits.\n\n\n\nDeliverables:\n\nBuild and manage sales team\n\nDevelop sales processes\n\nManage long sales cycles\n\nLead strategic sales initiatives\n\nOptimize HubSpot CRM                ",

Full-Time after 3 months\n\r\nTimezone: GMT+1 to GMT+4 (European / Middle Eastern business hours)\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nParmint is a 7-figure DTC supplement brand specializing in internal body freshness. We sell directly to consumers through high-converting funnels,\n/Meta ads, and\n marketing. Our core product helps people feel confident from the inside out — and we're growing fast.\n\r\nWe're looking for an Integrator — someone who can take the founder's vision and turn it into reality. You'll be the operational backbone of the company: building systems, managing people, executing strategies, and making sure nothing falls through the cracks.\n\r\nThis is NOT a virtual assistant role. This is a leadership position for someone who wants to help build and run a real company — with skin in the game through profit sharing.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nOperations & Systems: Create SOPs, workflows, and processes from scratch. Build the operational infrastructure that allows the company to scale without the founder being involved in every decision.\n\r\nTeam Management: Help identify, hire, and manage tea\nmbers (video editors, customer service, copywriters, media buyers). You'll be their point of contact and make sure everyone delivers on time and on quality.\n\r\nMarketing Execution: Oversee the execution of\n/Meta ad campaigns,\n sequences (Klaviyo), quiz funnels, landing pages, and creative production. You don't need to be the one running ads — but you need to deeply understand how DTC marketing works so you can manage people who do.\n\r\nProject Management: Keep all moving parts organized. From ad creative production to product launches to customer service escalations — you make sure things get done.\n\r\nFinancial Oversight: Help track budgets, manage invoices, reconcile expenses, and keep the founder informed on financial health.\n\r\nStrategic Support: Provide input on decisions, flag problems before they become crises, and bring structure to the founder's ideas.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've worked inside a DTC brand or agency (ideally $1M–$10M range). You know what a funnel is, how\n ads work, what Klaviyo does, and why AOV, LTV, and ROAS matter.\n\r\nYou've built or managed systems, processes, or teams in a previous role.\n\r\nEnglish fluency (written and spoken) — non-negotiable.\n\r\nAvailable during GMT+1 to GMT+4 business hours.\n\r\nSelf-starter: you see a problem, you flag it, you propose a solution, you execute.\n\r\nDetail-oriented and patient. You double-check everything and care about doing things right.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience in a supplement or health brand, especially marketing health products on Meta.\n\r\nHands-on experience with Shopify, Klaviyo, ClickFunnels, or similar tools.\n\r\nSpanish or Italian language skills.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\nBase: $2,000–$3,000/month (based on experience and location)\n\r\nBonus: 5–10% of net profits after 3-month trial period\n\r\nGrowth: This role grows into a full COO position as the company scales\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow It Works\n\r\nMonth 1–2 (Part-Time, ~20 hrs/week): You'll audit Parmint's operations — ads, funnels,\n, team, customer journey — and present an action plan with prioritized SOPs. This is our mutual test.\n\r\nMonth 3 (Decision Point): If the plan is solid and execution is strong, we move to full-time and profit sharing kicks in.\n\r\nMonth 4+ (Full-Time): You build systems, hire and manage the team, and run day-to-day operations. The founder focuses exclusively on growth strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend an\n to [YOUR\n] with the subject: \"Integrator — [Your Name]\"\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n\n\r\nA short intro about yourself (2–3 paragraphs max). Who are you, what have you done, why does this role interest you?\n\r\nYour experience with DTC/e-commerce brands. What brands did you work with? What was your role?

    "description": "\n                    OVERVIEW:\n\r\nWe are seeking a forward-thinking Video Editor who is highly proficient in AI image generation and animation. This is not a traditional stock-footage editing role. You will be responsible for using AI tools to generate consistent character assets and environments, animating those assets, and editing them into a seamless, professional educational experience. We provide the script, voiceover and image prompts to use for your chosen AI—you provide the visual world to create 10–25 minute educational finance videos.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be comfortable with high-volume, repetitive creative work and have a deep understanding of how to keep a recurring character looking identical across hundreds of prompts.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is structured as a Contract-to-Permanent engagement. We will initiate our partnership with a single, paid project to ensure a perfect alignment of creative vision and workflow. If the collaboration is a success for both parties, we intend to transition this into a long-term, full-time role with a consistent production schedule.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Challenge: Consistency at Scale:\n\r\nThe primary challenge of this role is Character Continuity. You must be able to generate a central character who maintains the exact same facial features, clothing style, and \"vibe\" across a 25-minute video involving hundreds of unique scenes. This requires a mastery of AI prompting (Character References/LoRAs) and the patience to handle the high-volume, repetitive nature of long-form production.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role:\n\r\nI will provide the script, image prompts and the voiceover file. Your job is to:\n\r\n 1 Prompt & Generate: Create all visual assets using AI (following a specific \"clean minimalist\" 2D style) using the AI generation model of your choice (Chat GPT, Gemini or etc.)\n\r\n 2 Image Animation: Use AI video tools (Grok, Runway, Luma, Kling, Pika) or manual techniques (After Effects Parallax/Puppet tools) to bring static AI images to life.\n\r\n 3 Construct: Edit the full 10–25 minute video, ensuring the pacing is perfect for an educational YouTube audience.\n\r\n 4 Educational Editing: Structure the video to help viewers digest complex financial topics. Use text overlays, data visualizations, and pacing that aids learning.\n\r\n 5 Volume Management: Efficiently manage the \"marathon\" workflow of creating a 25-minute video while maintaining high quality from minute 1 to minute 25 without a drop in quality. Must videos will run 10-20 mins with some being a little longer and some may be a little shorter.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n • Advanced AI Toolkit: Expert-level knowledge of AI image generation and video-to-video or image-to-video tools.\n\r\n • Portfolio of Consistency: You must demonstrate previous work where an AI-generated character remains consistent across multiple scenes.\n\r\n • Finance/Education Familiarity: An understanding of how to visualize financial concepts (bull/bear markets, interest rates, portfolio balancing) through clean, professional imagery.\n\r\n • Technical Editing: Proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve for the final assembly and sound design.\n\r\n • Process-Oriented & Stamina: Ability to handle the repetitive nature of generating assets for long-form content while maintaining a \"premium\" finish.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Instructions:\n\r\n* Examples of AI-generated characters where you maintained consistency across different environments/poses.\n\r\n* A brief note on your preferred AI stack for character consistency.

Accountant.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat “Senior” Means Here\n\r\nIn this role, “senior” does not mean:\n\r\nYears of experience alone or Knowing every rule by memory\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIt does mean:\n\r\nYou sanity-check your own work\n\r\nYou notice when results don’t align with reality\n\r\nYou raise issues even when it’s uncomfortable\n\r\nYou can explain why something matters, not just what

projections and consolidations\n\r\n\n\r\nAudit, accounting manager, or shared services leadership backgrounds are a strong plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Will Disqualify You\n\r\nPlease do not apply if:\n\r\nYou primarily “follow instructions” rather than question them\n\r\nYou wait to be told when something looks wrong\n\r\nYou are uncomfortable pushing back on clients or colleagues\n\r\nYou

work\n\r\nProblems identified early, not after the fact\n\r\nIncreased confidence from US reviewers in your output\n\r\nReduced rework and back-and-forth\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSpeed matters — but accuracy

real responsibility\n\r\nGood decisions are rewarded, not punished\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is a stepping stone to broader ownership as the firm scales.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Work With Us?\n\r\nMost accounting roles are designed to make you smaller.\n\r\nYou prepare.\n\r\n You escalate.\n\r\n You wait.\n\r\n Someone else thinks.\n\r\nThat is not what we are building.\n\r\nMonterra is building a next-generation accounting and advisory firm where:\n\r\nJudgment matters more than hierarchy\n\r\nGood decisions are valued more than perfect checklists\n\r\nSenior accountants are trusted to think, not just execute\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with multi-location operators and founders who rely on their numbers to make real decisions. That means the work is complex, sometimes messy, and always meaningful.\n\r\nIf you enjoy being challenged—and want your work to actually matter—this will feel very different from a traditional firm.\n\r\nPerformance-Driven Growth (Not Politics)\n\r\nProgression here is based on:\n\r\nQuality of judgment\n\r\nReduction in rework\n\r\nAbility to think independently\n\r\nClear communication\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNot:\n\r\nTenure\n\r\nLoudness\n\r\nInternal maneuvering\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong performers get:\n\r\nExpanded scope\n\r\nHigher-value clients\n\r\nLeadership responsibility\n\r\nCompensation growth tied to real contribution\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re ambitious and capable, you will not be stuck waiting.\n\r\nPractical, Adult Benefits\n\r\nWe keep perks practical, not gimmicky.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can expect:\n\r\nPaid time off (15–20 days)\n\r\nPaid volunteer days\n\r\nPaid flex time\n\r\nLocal public holidays respected\n\r\nTech stipend\n\r\nEquipment support if needed\n\r\nStable, long-term role (not contract churn)\n\r\n\n\r\nFor senior performers:\n\r\nPerformance-based bonuses\n\r\nExpanded flexibility\n\r\nLeadership opportunities as the firm scales\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not trying to build the biggest accounting firm.\n\r\nWe are building a serious firm—with serious standards—where senior professionals can do the best work of their careers without the bloat, politics, or ceiling that usually comes with it.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf that excites you, we want to hear from you.\n\r\nIf not, that’s okay.\n\r\nThis role is not for everyone—by design.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want:\n\r\nMaximum pay for minimum responsibility ? this is not it\n\r\nA quiet role where no one notices you ? not a fit\n\r\nEndless instructions and checklists ? look elsewhere\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want:\n\r\nTo be trusted\n\r\nTo grow quickly\n\r\nTo work with people who take the work seriously\n\r\nTo build a modern firm instead of inheriting a broken one\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is one of the best seats you can get in the market.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (Important)\n\r\nTo apply, complete the application at: \n \n\r\n\n\r\nFinal Note\n\r\nWe are selective by design.\n\r\n If this role feels demanding, that’s intentional.\n\r\nFor the right person, this is a chance to do real accounting work — with real ownership — without US firm politics or bloat.
