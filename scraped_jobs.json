    "description": "\n                    ABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a US-based commerce company, the American arm of an established European e-commerce and trading group operating across 29 countries with 650,000+ products across multiple brands in construction, home improvement, sustainability, and premium bath & kitchen.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are also a US distributor of a European contactless QR-payment solution for churches, nonprofits, and venues.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur motto: \"Do it with Passion or don't do it at all.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are building a Commerce 4.0 infrastructure with AI-driven automation, and we need a sharp, resourceful person to become the CEO's digital right hand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT A TYPICAL VA ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who thinks like an entrepreneur, not just an assistant. You will co-build operations across the USA and Southeast Asia, manage teams, drive sales, and grow with us into a leadership position. If you want to be part of building something big - this is your opportunity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE - SIX KEY AREAS\n\r\n\n\r\n1. US FINTECH PRODUCT - Sales & Distribution Support\n\r\nWe distribute a European contactless QR-payment solution for churches, zoos, museums, and nonprofits in the US market. We're building the sales infrastructure from scratch - so tell us what tools you've worked with and we'll set it up together.\n\r\n- Build and maintain lead lists (churches, zoos, museums, nonprofits across the US)\n\r\n- Set up and manage a CRM pipeline from zero (you recommend the tool, we d\n together)\n\r\n- Coordinate\n campaigns and follow-ups with our US Managing Partner\n\r\n- Prepare sales materials, proposals, and demo scheduling\n\r\n- Research target markets and verticals\n\r\nAs this grows, you'll hire sales support and manage them - so you need to understand the full sales cycle yourself first.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. VIETNAM & SOUTHEAST ASIA - Team Building\n\r\nWe are building a remote operations team in Southeast Asia (Vietnam and Philippines). You will help recruit, onboard, and coordinate.\n\r\n- Post job openings on local platforms (VietnamWorks, TopCV, TopDev, OnlineJobs.ph)\n\r\n- Screen candidates, conduct initial interviews, coordinate with CEO for final decisions\n\r\n- Set up daily standups, reporting, and project tracking (Slack, Notion, GitHub)\n\r\n- Act as the bridge between Austrian HQ and the Southeast Asian team\n\r\n- Help evaluate EOR providers and manage contractor compliance\n\r\nYou'll eventually hand off daily coordination to a local team lead - but first you need to build the processes and understand what good looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. E-COMMERCE BACKOFFICE & OPERATIONS\n\r\nOur European parent company operates multiple brands and marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, ManoMano, own webshops). A core priority from Day 1 is launching (or relaunching) our US marketplace channels - Amazon USA, eBay USA, and later Walmart.\n\r\n- Build, optimize, and launch product listings on Amazon, eBay, and Walmart US\n\r\n- Develop pricing strategies, fulfillment setup (FBA/FBM), and shipping logistics for the US market\n\r\n- Marketplace ticket management and customer communication\n\r\n- Order processing, supplier coordination, shipping tracking\n\r\n- EPR compliance tracking across European jurisdictions\n\r\n- Product data management and listing optimization\n\r\nOnce the channels run smoothly, you'll hire dedicated marketplace managers - but you need to have done it yourself to know what \"smooth\" looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AUTOMATION & DIGITAL TOOLS\n\r\nWe automate everything we can. You should be comfortable with modern tools.\n\r\n- Help build and maintain workflows in n8n (our automation platform)\n\r\n- Create reports, dashboards, and data summaries\n\r\n- Manage content calendars for LinkedIn and social media\n\r\n- Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) productively for content, research, and analysis\n\r\n- Document processes and create SOPs for repeatable tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n5. FINANCE & ACCOUNTING\n\r\nYou take ownership of the financial back office and make sure everything is clean, organized, and transparent.\n\r\n- Restructure and maintain the bookkeeping system across multiple entities (US and Europe)\n\r\n- Prepare and track invoices, credit notes, and payment reminders\n\r\n- Monitor incoming and outgoing payments, reconcile bank accounts\n\r\n- Coordinate with the external accountant and tax advisor (monthly closings, VAT filings, annual statements)\n\r\n- Prepare financial summaries and reports for the CEO\n\r\n- Track expenses, budgets, and profitability per channel and brand\n\r\n- Ensure compliance with local tax requirements across jurisdictions\n\r\n\n\r\n6. DIGITAL MARKETING & SOCIAL COMMERCE\n\r\nModern e-commerce doesn't work without strong digital presence. You'll build and manage our marketing channels.\n\r\n- LinkedIn content strategy and posting (for the CEO and company profiles)\n\r\n- TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube for product marketing and brand building\n\r\n- AI-generated content creation (using tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney for posts, videos, and ads)\n\r\n- Influencer marketing and AI influencer strategies\n\r\n-\n and Instagram Shopping integration\n\r\n-\n marketing and newsletter campaigns\n\r\n- SEO basics and performance tracking\n\r\n- Paid ads coordination (Google Ads, Meta Ads - working with specialists)\n\r\nYou don't need to be a full-time content creator - but you need to understand what works, set the strategy, and eventually hire specialists (content creators, video editors, ad managers) that you can properly manage and evaluate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Personality:\n\r\nYou are the kind of person who opens their laptop in the morning and already knows what needs to happen today - without being told. You learn new tools over a weekend, not in a training program. When something breaks, you don't wait for instructions - you find a fix, implement it, and then report what you did. You thrive in fast-paced environments where no two days look the same.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're comfortable making decisions on your own in day-to-day operations (backoffice, tickets, scheduling), but you also know when to check in with the CEO on strategic calls (hiring decisions, client communication, new processes). You're not looking for a 9-to-5 routine - you want to build something and grow with it.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: THE COORDINATOR MINDSET\n\r\n\n\r\nLet's be clear about what this role really is. We don't expect you to be a world-class expert in every single area listed below. What we DO expect is that you've done enough of it yourself to truly understand how it works - the pain points, the shortcuts, the quality standards. Why? Because your real job is to build a team around you that handles the specialist work, and you need to be able to tell the difference between great work and garbage. You can only control what you understand. If you've never run an ad campaign, you can't evaluate someone who does it for you. If you've never reconciled a bank account, you won't catch mistakes. We need someone who has been in the trenches, understands the work, and can then hire, train, and manage the people who do it day-to-day. You don't need to be the best at everything - but you need to have done everything at least once.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Skills That Matter Most:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Fast Learner & Tech-Native (Most Important)\n\r\nThis is non-negotiable. Our stack changes, our tools evolve, and we move fast. You pick up a new platform in hours, not weeks. If someone shows you n8n or a new CRM, you're productive within days.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. High Capacity & Multitasking Under Pressure\n\r\nYou'll manage sales leads in the morning, screen a developer candidate in Southeast Asia before lunch, handle marketplace tickets in the afternoon, and prepare a report for the CEO by evening. You need to context-switch cleanly and keep quality high across all areas.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Professional Communication\n\r\nYou write\ns that clients and partners take seriously. Your English is flawless - not just grammatically correct, but professional, clear, and appropriate for business contexts in the US and Europe.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.

Second Bridge Associates is looking for a Head of Acquisitions to serve as a key player in our company growth. We specialize in two primary asset classes:\n\r\n1) Short-Term Rentals (STRs)\n\r\n2) Seattle In-Fill Development Projects\n\r\n\n\r\nOur perfect fit for this role is a strategic partner who is excited to own our entire acquisitions pipeline. You will be the bridge between data analysis and the purchase of high-yield assets.\n\r\n\n\r\nAvailability & Timezone\n\r\n- Available to work Monday–Friday during Pacific Time (PST) hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\n- Own Seattle Development & STR Analysis: Develop deep expertise in STR and Seattle development math. You will have the final say on whether a deal meets our feasibility and ROI benchmarks.\n\r\n- Master the Deal Pipeline: Take full accountability for our deal flow ecosystem. You are accountable for a steady pipeline of 6-8 qualified deals a year. You’ll source opportunities through off-market outreach, wholesaler networks, and on-market channels.\n\r\n- Lead & Scale Operations: Own the entire team lifecycle from process creation to performance management. You’ll be responsible for creating robust SOPs, while serving as a mentor to our existing team. We look to you to identify talent gaps and strategically expand our acquisitions department as deal flow accelerates.\n\r\n- Strategize for Market Shifts: When the market moves, you move faster. You’ll proactively refine our buying criteria and pivot strategies to ensure we stay competitive.\n\r\n- Seamless Handoffs: Once a deal is inked, you’ll lead the transition to our operations team, ensuring every project starts with a clear roadmap and a shared vision.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n- A Seasoned Pro: You have a proven track record in real estate acquisitions. You speak the language of sellers, agents, and wholesalers, and know how to build relationships with them.\n\r\n- A Systems Thinker: You don't just \"do\" work; you build systems and processes. You’re comfortable in Notion, CRMs, and data-tracking tools to find the right deals from your network and also track them to offers.\n\r\n- A Leader of Remote Teams: You know how to get the best out of a virtual team, keeping them motivated and high-performing.\n\r\n- Analytical & Decisive: You can look at a pro-forma and see the risks and rewards instantly. You make data-driven decisions, but you have the gut instinct of a sales closer.\n\r\n- High Energy & Growth-Oriented: You tackle challenges with a solutions-focused mindset and a touch of humor. You’re here to win and celebrate the wins with the team.\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Profile\n\r\n- 4+ Years in Real Estate Acquisitions: Deep experience in deal sourcing, offer negotiation, and closing - specifically in short-term rentals or in-fill development.\n\r\n- Proven Closer: You have a track record of hitting (and exceeding) volume targets and managing high-value pipelines.\n\r\n- Architect of Systems: Expert-level ability to build SOPs, design CRM workflows, and turn \"hustle\" into a repeatable machine.\n\r\n- Data-Driven Mindset: You live in spreadsheets; you are comfortable defining KPIs and adjusting strategy based on what the numbers say.\n\r\n- Tool Mastery: Proficiency across Workspace Tools (e.g., Google Sheets, Slack, Notion, Zillow, Redfin, MLS)\n\r\n- STR Enthusiast: You understand that Short-Term Rentals are a hybrid of real estate and hospitality. You know how to look at the qualitative factors that impact a property’s performance.\n\r\n- The \"Extreme Ownership\" Mindset: You don't wait for permission to fix a leak in the pipeline. You identify the problem, build the solution, and report on the results.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus:\n\r\n- Existing relationships with Seattle-based wholesalers, brokers, or developers. \n\r\n- You have a background in Seattle real estate underwriting already or a deep understanding of urban in-fill development. You understand that a \"good deal\" in Seattle looks different than anywhere else.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us?\n\r\nAt Second Bridge Associates, we value curiosity, independence, and results. We’re looking for someone who is excited to grow at our fast-paced company where they will be empowered to take on ownership from Day 1.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf that sounds like you, we’re excited to hear from you :) Ready to find our next great investment?

We are building out all aspects of our team to scale operations and reduce dependence on external agencies.\n\r\n \n\r\nOur small team is the reason for our success. With fewer layers, every voice is heard and every action is visible. We operate with core values that guide everything we do:\n\r\n \n\r\n•       Be an Owner: Act with the same care, urgency, professionalism, and creativity you would bring to your own business.\n\r\n•       Make People Say “Wow!”: Whether they are customers or teammates, we aim to surprise and delight through service that goes beyond expectations.\n\r\n \n\r\nEach of us is quick to lend a hand, share knowledge, and celebrate wins, large or small. We believe the best work happens when talented people serve one another, take full ownership of their craft, and consistently bring their best selves to the table. If you thrive in a collaborative environment where initiative is valued and a single outstanding idea can shape an entire brand, you’ll fit right in.\n\r\n \n\r\nAbout Your Role\n\r\nWe’re seeking a highly analytical Amazon Listing Analytics Manager who can turn data into actionable insights and measurable results. While Amazon platform knowledge is valuable, we prioritize candidates with strong analytical foundations who excel at data analysis, experiment design, and strategic thinking. We’ll teach you Amazon—you bring the analytical horsepower.\n\r\n \n\r\nAs our Listing Analytics Manager, you’ll own the performance of all existing Amazon listings across two premium brands through data-driven experimentation and optimization. You’ll build the reporting infrastructure, design and execute A/B tests, monitor the competitive landscape, and present actionable recommendations to executive leadership.\n\r\n \n\r\nKey Differentiator: This is not a listing copywriter or content creator. This is a performance analyst who uses data to identify opportunities, design experiments, and drive measurable improvement in marketplace effectiveness.\n\r\n \n\r\nYour focus: maximize conversion rates on existing listings, build automated reporting infrastructure, provide competitive intelligence, and create a data-driven optimization system that scales with our growth.\n\r\n \n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n•       Build and maintain performance dashboards: Develop comprehensive tracking for conversion rate (CVR), click-through rate (CTR), Total Sessions, and keyword rankings across all mature listings. Transform raw Amazon Business Reports into automated, actionable dashboards for executive leadership.\n\r\n•       Design and execute listing experiments: Create properly structured A/B tests on titles, bullet points, A+ content, and image positioning. Establish clear hypotheses, controls, sample sizes, and success metrics. Measure statistical significance and extract insights that inform strategy.\n\r\n•       Perform systematic competitive intelligence: Monitor competitor listings, pricing strategies, keyword positioning, and content approaches on a routine basis. Identify threats and opportunities proactively, enabling strategic responses before revenue impact occurs.\n\r\n•       Generate weekly performance reports with strategic recommendations: Communicate findings clearly to the COO and CEO with actionable insights—not data dumps. Quantify revenue impact of optimization opportunities and prioritize by estimated return.\n\r\n•       Automate reporting infrastructure: Eliminate manual data collection overhead. Build scalable systems that provide real-time visibility into listing performance across an expanding product catalog.\n\r\n•       Stay current with Amazon algorithm changes and marketplace trends: Continuously learn new optimization strategies, platform updates, and emerging best practices to maintain competitive advantage.\n\r\n \n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n•       Strong analytical mindset with demonstrated ability to interpret complex datasets and identify actionable patterns\n\r\n•       Advanced proficiency in Excel or Google Sheets (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, complex formulas, data visualization)\n\r\n•       Experience with data analysis, statistical thinking, or business intelligence\n\r\n•       Proven experience designing and running A/B tests with statistical rigor (hypothesis, controls, sample size, significance testing)\n\r\n•       Proven track record using metrics and testing to drive measurable improvements\n\r\n•       Excellent attention to detail with systematic, process-oriented approach\n\r\n•       Strong written communication skills—reports must be clear, concise, and actionable for executives\n\r\n \n\r\nDesired Experience / Background\n\r\n•       1–3 years experience in e-commerce analytics, digital marketing, SEO, or data analysis roles\n\r\n•       Hands-on experience with Amazon Seller Central analytics (listing-level CVR, CTR, Sessions—not just PPC)\n\r\n•       Background in A/B testing, conversion rate optimization (CRO), or growth marketing\n\r\n•       Experience building reporting infrastructure and automated dashboards from scratch\n\r\n•       Familiarity with competitive intelligence monitoring in e-commerce\n\r\n•       Experience with multi-brand or multi-product portfolio analysis\n\r\n \n\r\nDesired Technical Skills\n\r\n•       Experience with Amazon-specific analytics tools (Helium 10, SellerBoard, Jungle Scout, Cerebro) or ability to learn quickly\n\r\n•       Proficiency with data visualization tools (Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI, or similar)\n\r\n•       Experience with keyword research and SEO analysis platforms\n\r\n•       Strong data modeling skills with ability to forecast trends and build projections\n\r\n•       Experience with SQL for data querying and manipulation\n\r\n•       Comfortable working with APIs and data automation tools\n\r\n•       Working knowledge of statistical analysis methods (significance testing, confidence intervals, sample size calculation)\n\r\n \n\r\nDesired Interpersonal Skills\n\r\n•       High attention to detail with commitment to data accuracy\n\r\n•       Strong written and verbal communication skills for presenting insights to executive leadership\n\r\n•       Self-motivated with ability to work independently in remote environment\n\r\n•       Strategic thinker who connects data insights to business outcomes and revenue impact\n\r\n•       Ownership mindset—proactive in identifying problems, designing experiments, and proposing solutions\n\r\n•       Collaborative team player who coordinates effectively across departments\n\r\n•       Comfortable with ambiguity and rapid iteration based on results\n\r\n•       Process-driven—builds repeatable systems rather than one-off analyses\n\r\n \n\r\nIf you are interested in joining our team, please apply using the below link.\n\r\n\n                ",

    "description": "\n                    Job Description:\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe're a blockchain/DeFi company running production infrastructure that's bleeding money unnecessarily. Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you. Show us what you've done.                ",

Are you the one who remembers everyone’s birthdays, plans amazing gatherings, makes fun plans, and brings warmth into the lives of those around you?\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT your typical assistant job. It’s deeply personal. You’ll work with a kind but intense U.S.-based pair of brothers (proven entrepreneurs working as Co-CEOs of the same business) to support their lives, not the company they are building. From keeping friendships alive and planning meaningful experiences to sending thoughtful gifts and helping them stay on track with personal goals, you’ll be part organizer, part cheerleader, part coach. If you’ve ever been called the “mom” of your group and you’re looking for a decades-long position, this might be your dream job.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Role\n\r\n- Build trust by executing on tasks and communicating clearly, which will lead to taking on more responsibility, which will then lead to increases in pay.\n\r\n- Keep relationships thriving by managing a personal CRM and helping stay in touch with friends and family.\n\r\n- Use technology to help automate certain tasks that are repetitive.\n\r\n- Track habits, support routines, and act as an accountability partner for personal goals.\n\r\n- Pick out thoughtful, creative gifts for birthdays and other special \nnts.\n\r\n- Research products, tools, and ideas to make life easier, better, or more fun.\n\r\n- Plan and book unforgettable travel, great hotels, and the perfect dinner spots.\n\r\n- Jump in on special personal projects wherever a helping hand is needed.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat’s In It for You\n\r\n- A Long-Term Role: This is meant to last. The entrepreneurs who you'd be an assistant to are looking for a lifetime assistant.\n\r\n- Great Place to Work: These entrepreneurs are known to have a super high retention rate of employees and create a great work environment.\n\r\n- Creative Work: From planning memorable trips to picking out the perfect gift, this role lets you flex your creative muscles and thoughtful side every day.\n\r\n- Variety: No two days will feel the same. You’ll get to research, plan, coach, organize, and more.\n\r\n- Paid Leave: You'll get at least 10 days of paid leave plus major holidays.\n\r\n- Remote Flexibility: Work from the comfort of your home and gain flexibility with hours once trust is built.\n\r\n\n\r\nDesired Attributes\n\r\n- Extremely caring, social people-person who will excel in personal tasks\n\r\n- High attention to detail and organizational skills\n\r\n- Very strong written and oral English skills\n\r\n- Minimum 50 Mbps Internet Speed\n\r\n- Designated office space in your home\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply and ensure your application is considered, do all of the following two steps:\n\r\n1.

Include the word \"cupcake\" *in your subject line*, and Include your resume. ++Bonus points for a video introduction, though it's not strictly required\n\r\n2. Fill out this form:\n\r\n3.

Full-Time)\n\r\nHours: Part-time to start and then quickly ramp up into 35-40 hours per week (expect to go fulltime)\n\r\nCompensation: $15-$20/hour (based on experience) + performance-based bonus opportunities\n\r\nReports To: Founder / CFO (Christopher Carter)\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease Apply Here: \n\r\nAbout Carter Business Consultants\n\r\nCarter Business Consultants serves independent auto repair shop owners ($1M–$5M revenue per location) by providing:\n\r\nAccrual-based bookkeeping\n\r\nFinancial clarity\n\r\nIndustry-specific KPI reporting\n\r\nCFO advisory support\n\r\nOur mission is to give shop owners accurate, actionable financials so they can make confident decisions and build profitable, sustainable businesses.\n\r\nOur long-term vision is to build a scalable, systems-driven firm where the Founder focuses on sales and CFO advisory, not day-to-day bookkeeping execution.\n\r\nWe operate on these values:\n\r\nAccuracy above all — the numbers must tell the truth\n\r\nOwnership — problems are solved, not passed upward\n\r\nContinuous improvement — systems evolve and get stronger\n\r\nIntegrity & faith-led leadership\n\r\nThis role is foundational to operational excellence at CBC.\n\r\nRole Overview\n\r\nThe Automotive Bookkeeper Account Manager is the operational owner of assigned client accounts.\n\r\nThis is a Senior Execution Seat, not an entry-level bookkeeping role.\n\r\nYou are responsible for:\n\r\nAccurate month-end closes\n\r\nWorkflow compliance\n\r\nQuality control\n\r\nClient-level bookkeeping execution\n\r\nCleanup projects\n\r\nEscalation discipline\n\r\nTime efficiency\n\r\nThe Founder should not be fixing reconciliations, correcting basic errors, or rescuing files at the last minute.\n\r\nIf that is happening, this seat is not functioning properly.\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\nClient Account Ownership\n\r\nManage 8–15 automotive bookkeeping clients\n\r\nOwn full month-end close process\n\r\nEnsure reconciliations are complete and accurate\n\r\nDeliver files ready for Founder review\n\r\nMaintain clean, accurate balance sheets\n\r\nProactively flag anomalies or concerns\n\r\nYou are accountable for file quality before it reaches the Founder.\n\r\nAutomotive-Specific Accounting\n\r\nThis niche requires strong reconciliation skills and comfort with manual processes.\n\r\nYou must become proficient in:\n\r\nWorking with third-party shop management systems\n\r\nReconciling summary journal entries into QuickBooks Online\n\r\nManaging high-volume vendor payables (O’Reilly, AutoZone, Advance, etc.)\n\r\nReconciling clearing accounts\n\r\nCustomer deposit & AR reconciliation\n\r\nAccrual-based bookkeeping standards\n\r\nManual journal entry accuracy\n\r\nThis role requires advanced problem-solving, not task-following.\n\r\nMonth-End Close Deadlines (Critical KPI)\n\r\nFiles must be ready for Founder review by the 10th business day of each month\n\r\nClient financial delivery deadline is the 15th business day\n\r\nEscalations must occur before Day 8\n\r\nNo last-minute emergency fixes due to avoidable delays\n\r\nFailure to meet delivery timelines is a performance issue.\n\r\nWorkflow & Double Compliance (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\nDouble is CBC’s system of record.\n\r\nYou are required to:\n\r\nComplete and check off every task in Double\n\r\nMark tasks complete or cancelled — no silent omissions\n\r\nAvoid parallel spreadsheets outside approved workflows\n\r\nUse Double as the single source of truth\n\r\nFailure to use Double correctly prevents operational visibility and is considered a performance issue.\n\r\nEscalation Protocol (Required Behavior)\n\r\nYou must follow the documented escalation framework:\n\r\nFollow defined timelines for client follow-up\n\r\nUse approved\n/templates for missing documents\n\r\nDocument escalation steps inside Double\n\r\nEscalate only after required steps are completed\n\r\nFounder is the last point of escalation\n\r\nDo not escalate basic bookkeeping questions.\n\r\n“Ask Three Before Me” Standard\n\r\nBefore escalating a question, you must:\n\r\nCheck the SOP\n\r\nCheck Double documentation\n\r\nPropose a solution\n\r\nDo not bring problems without suggested next steps.\n\r\nThis is a professional expectation at CBC.\n\r\nQuality Control\n\r\nReview your work before submission\n\r\nZero unreconciled accounts\n\r\nZero uncleared transactions\n\r\nFollow structured close checklist\n\r\nDeliver clean files, not 85% files\n\r\nAccuracy is the baseline expectation.\n\r\nCleanup & Catch-Up Projects\n\r\nExecute year-end cleanup projects within estimated budgets\n\r\nTarget: ~30 hours per year cleanup unless complexity requires otherwise\n\r\nProtect company margin\n\r\nDocument recurring errors for prevention\n\r\nCleanups must not balloon due to inefficiency.\n\r\nTime Tracking & Efficiency\n\r\nAll time must be tracked daily in Clockify (or approved system)\n\r\nTime is reviewed weekly\n\r\nEfficiency per client is measured\n\r\nExcessive hours without explanation will be addressed\n\r\nMaintain profitability per client\n\r\nThis is a business, not a hobby.\n\r\nLimited Client Communication\n\r\nRespond to bookkeeping-related client inquiries\n\r\nRequest documentation\n\r\nFollow escalation framework\n\r\nEscalate strategic decisions to Founder\n\r\nClients should feel supported — not chaotic.\n\r\nPerformance Standards\n\r\nThis role operates under a structured 90-day performance framework.\n\r\nThe following are considered performance issues:\n\r\nMissed deadlines\n\r\nFailure to follow workflow\n\r\nRepeated basic errors\n\r\nNot using Double properly\n\r\nExcessive escalations\n\r\nLack of ownership\n\r\nMay result in:\n\r\nFormal Performance Improvement Plan\n\r\nReduced client load\n\r\nTermination\n\r\nExpectations are clear and documented.\n\r\nKPIs\n\r\n30 Days:\n\r\nUnderstand automotive workflow\n\r\nManage 3–5 accounts independently\n\r\nDemonstrate Double compliance\n\r\n60 Days:\n\r\nManage 8+ accounts\n\r\nDeliver files by Day 10 consistently\n\r\nMaintain clean reconciliations\n\r\nDemonstrate independent problem-solving\n\r\n90 Days:\n\r\nFounder no longer performing QC\n\r\nMonth-end runs smoothly\n\r\nEscalations significantly reduced\n\r\nClients consistently delivered on time\n\r\nRequired Qualifications\n\r\n4+ years professional bookkeeping experience\n\r\nAdvanced QuickBooks Online proficiency\n\r\nStrong accrual accounting knowledge\n\r\nExperience reconciling high-volume payables\n\r\nExperience working with U.S. clients\n\r\nExcellent written English\n\r\nPreferred:\n\r\nAutomotive accounting experience\n\r\nCPA or accounting credential\n\r\nExperience in niche bookkeeping firm\n\r\nRequired Traits\n\r\nWe are specifically hiring for:\n\r\nOwnership mentality\n\r\nHigh accountability\n\r\nStrong reconciliation confidence\n\r\nProblem-solving initiative\n\r\nComfort with complexity\n\r\nProcess discipline\n\r\nCalm under pressure\n\r\nWe are not hiring someone who:\n\r\nAvoids difficult reconciliations\n\r\nRequires constant direction\n\r\nEscalates simple issues\n\r\nResists systems\n\r\nCultural Fit\n\r\nComfortable working in a faith-led company\n\r\nValues operational clarity\n\r\nCommunicates professionally\n\r\nGrowth-oriented\n\r\nFuture Growth\n\r\nThis role may grow into:\n\r\nSenior Account Lead\n\r\nOversight of junior

    "description": "\n                    INTRODUCTION: Hello! \n (on IG). I'm an entrepreneur that started by buying rentals and is now developing houses by building and renovating in Nashville, TN. Now with ~35 units, I established a property management company (\n) to manage them. My goal is 100 rental units, but to get there I need your help! I rely heavily on my team in place to keep things running smoothly so I can grow the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation: Remote\n\r\nTime Schedule: Business hours M - F in the U.S.A. (Overnight hours in the Philippines)\n\r\nCompensation: $6-8/hr USD, paid bi-weekly via Onlinejobs.ph\n\r\nBenefits: Paid USA bank holidays (~13 days) after trial period.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Summary:\n\r\nFlywheel needs an APM to run the day to day business operations. You will report to me, Allan, for confirming outcome metrics and overcoming obstacles. You are the singular employee of Flywheel and play a critical role in its success!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Perks:\n\r\n    • Play a direct role in a growing local company and enjoy a distinct sense of satisfaction from seeing results that YOU made happen.\n\r\n    • Enjoy autonomy of identifying and handling tasks using your own judgment, without micromanagement of a supervisor. \n\r\n    • Plenty of training provided to build on your existing experience and ensure your success!   \n\r\n\n\r\nA Typical Week:\n\r\n    • Receive notice of a tenant not renewing lease. Schedule contractor to begin turnover repairs.\n\r\n    • Receive a maintenance request from a unit in the software, and forward to the appropriate vendor.\n\r\n    • Follow up on certain tenants if rent not received on the 1st.\n\r\n    • Run month-end reports and distribute to rental property owners.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications:\n\r\n    • Read sections “Outcomes” & “Core Competencies” down below.\n\r\n    • This job is not for a “first timer”. Only those with Property Management experience need apply.\n\r\n    • Level of Completed Education: N/A\n\r\n    • English Fluency: 4+ out of 5. Some accent is fine but must be easy to understand.\n\r\n\n\r\n===============================================\n\r\n\n\r\nMission: To manage a rental property portfolio for maximum profitability, especially by turning vacancies quickly and handling repairs and maintenance requests quickly and cost-effectively.\n\r\n\n\r\nOutcomes: Property Management \n\r\n    • Rent collections are at 100% by the end of each month (excluding detainer warrants).\n\r\n    • Vacant units are filled in less than 3 weeks by getting units rent-ready, listing them, and screening tenants.\n\r\n    • Global Vacancy stays at or below 5% on a trailing 30 day basis (different from the above in that low global vacancy means tenants are staying and renewing leases likely due to effective management)\n\r\n    • All valid maintenance requests are completed within 7 days by quickly scheduling vendors and following up.\n\r\n    • Recurring tasks are performed on time by completing each item in the SOP’s checklists (Ex: Interim inspections, monthly owner statements and distributions).\n\r\n    •                 ",
