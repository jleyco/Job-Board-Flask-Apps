Because what you gain here goes far beyond what most people get from:\n\r\n- College classes\n\r\n- Online courses\n\r\n- Free tutorials\n\r\n- Entry-level internships that keep you busy but don’t build credibility\n\r\n\n\r\nThis program is designed to give you real-world experience, professional proof of work, and agency-level training—the things employers actually care about.\n\r\n\n\r\nBe honest—how long have you been applying with no success?\n\r\n- Weeks?\n\r\n- Months?\n\r\n- Dozens (or hundreds) of applications with no replies?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re capable, motivated, and willing to work—but keep getting ignored—this isn’t because you lack talent.\n\r\n\n\r\nIt’s because you lack verifiable professional experience and positioning.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat’s what this internship fixes.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Internship Is Different\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not an internship where you “help out” or wait to be told what to do.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a professional training ground where you:\n\r\n- Work on real projects with real standards\n\r\n- Learn how modern digital agencies actually operate\n\r\n- Use AI strategically (not lazily or irresponsibly)\n\r\n- Build proof of work you can confidently show employers\n\r\n\n\r\nBy the end of this program, you won’t just say:\n\r\n“I learned this in school.”\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll say:\n\r\n“Here’s what I built. Here’s how I think. Here’s the impact.”\n\r\n\n\r\nThat’s the difference between being overlooked and being taken seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\nMore Valuable Than Most College Classes (Here’s Why)\n\r\nMost college courses:\n\r\n- Teach theory, not execution\n\r\n- Don’t expose you to real deadlines or standards\n\r\n- Don’t prepare you for how work actually happens\n\r\n\n\r\nThis program:\n\r\n- Trains you under an active media agency\n\r\n- Forces you to think, deliver, and communicate professionally\n\r\n- Gives you real experience, not simulated assignments\n\r\n- Helps you graduate with confidence, clarity, and credibility\n\r\nMany interns finish this program with more practical experience than years of coursework alone.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Program Is For\n\r\nThis is for Filipinos who:\n\r\n- Are tired of being “qualified but ignored”\n\r\n- Want experience, not just certificates\n\r\n- Are serious about long-term career growth\n\r\n- Are coachable, disciplined, and dependable\n\r\n- Want to stand out in agencies, corporate roles, or freelancing\n\r\n- If you’re looking for easy money—this is not for you.\n\r\n- If you’re looking to invest your time to change your trajectory—this might be exactly what you’ve been waiting for.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Learn\n\r\n- AI-powered strategy and content creation\n\r\n- Social media & platform development\n\r\n- Public relations and professional writing\n\r\n- Business development fundamentals\n\r\n- How to think like a professional—not a task-taker\n\r\n\n\r\nAll under the guidance of the Walker Media Leadership Team.\n\r\n\n\r\nProgram Details\n\r\nDuration: 4 months\n\r\nTime Commitment: 10 hours/week\n\r\n- 2 hrs live training & meetings\n\r\n- 4 hrs reading & guided journaling\n\r\n- 4 hrs real-world practicum projects\n\r\nFormat: 100% remote\n\r\nAcceptance: Very limited & competitive\n\r\n\n\r\nThe program ends with a virtual graduation, certificate, and portfolio-ready experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nLearn More (Required Before Applying)\n\r\nFull program details:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease review carefully. This program is selective by design.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT – PROOF YOU READ THIS\n\r\nTo be considered, you must include this exact phrase at the top of your application message:\n\r\n“I’m ready to invest my time to earn my place as a Walker Media Rockstar Intern.”\n\r\nApplications without this phrase will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’ve been stuck waiting for someone to “give you a chance,” this program helps you earn one instead.\n\r\n\n\r\nApply intentionally. Show up seriously. Change your future.\n\r\n\n\r\n************************************************\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions (Please Read Carefully)\n\r\nIs this internship paid?\n\r\n\n\r\nNo. This is a non-paid internship.\n\r\nHowever, this is not free labor. This is a structured, mentored professional training program.\n\r\nIf this experience were offered as a private professional accelerator or certification program, you would normally pay to participate. Instead, you are investing time and effort in exchange for:\n\r\n- Real-world experience\n\r\n- Professional proof of work\n\r\n- Direct training under an active media agency\n\r\n- Career-ready skills that employers actually value\n\r\n\n\r\nMany participants finish with more practical experience than years of coursework alone.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy would I join an unpaid internship?\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause experience is the currency that gets you hired.\n\r\nMost people remain stuck because they:\n\r\n- Have skills but no proof\n\r\n- Have knowledge but no execution\n\r\n- Have motivation but no positioning\n\r\n\n\r\nThis program gives you verifiable experience, structure, standards, and credibility—the things that move you from “applicant” to “top candidate.”\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re only looking for immediate income, this may not be the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re focused on long-term career growth, this can be a turning point.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow much time does this really take each week?\n\r\n\n\r\nThe commitment is 10 hours per week:\n\r\n2 hours – live virtual training & meetings\n\r\n4 hours – reading and guided journaling\n\r\n4 hours – real-world practicum projects\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is designed to be manageable alongside other responsibilities, but it does require consistency and discipline.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat if I already have a job or freelance work?\n\r\n\n\r\nThat’s fine—as long as you can honor the 10-hour weekly commitment and attend required live sessions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care less about what else you’re doing and more about:\n\r\n- Reliability\n\r\n- Preparation\n\r\n-Follow-through\n\r\n\n\r\nMissed meetings, late work, or inconsistent effort will not be tolerated.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat are the expectations during the program?\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are expected to:\n\r\n- Show up on time and prepared\n\r\n- Communicate professionally\n\r\n- Meet deadlines without excuses\n\r\n- Accept feedback and apply it\n\r\n- Protect confidential information\n\r\n\n\r\nThis program operates with agency-level standards, not student standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWill this help me get hired after?\n\r\n\n\r\nThis program does not guarantee a job.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat it does give you is:\n\r\n- Real experience you can confidently speak about\n\r\n- Proof of work you can show employers or clients\n\r\n- Strong professional habits and communication\n\r\n- A clear upgrade in how you present yourself\n\r\nThat combination dramatically improves your chances—if you do the work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho should NOT apply?\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not apply if:\n\r\n- You are looking for easy money\n\r\n- You struggle with deadlines or accountability\n\r\n- You are not open to feedback\n\r\n- You cannot commit 10 hours per week\n\r\n- You expect to be “hand-held”\n\r\nThis program is demanding by design.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho SHOULD apply?\n\r\nApply if you:\n\r\n- Are tired of being overlooked\n\r\n- Want real experience—not just certificates\n\r\n- Are serious about your professional future\n\r\n- Are willing to invest time to gain credibility\n\r\n- Want to raise your standard and expectations\n\r\n\n\r\nFINAL REMINDER – REQUIRED TO APPLY\n\r\nTo prove you read and understood this post, you must include this exact phrase at the top of your application message:\n\r\n“I’m ready to invest my time to earn my place as a Walker Media Rockstar Intern.”\n\r\nApplications without this phrase will not be reviewed.

I'm launching Pi9 AI — a €997 course that teaches solo coaches, therapists, and consultants how to market themselves on LinkedIn without losing their soul.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT generic \"LinkedIn tips\" content.\n\r\nThis is psychology-informed, purpose-driven marketing for conscious professionals who HATE traditional marketing tactics.\n\r\nI'm looking for a Filipino ghostwriter who can help me launch this in the next 50 days.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Makes This Project Different:\n\r\n\n\r\nMost LinkedIn courses teach:\n\r\n\"Post 5x/day and go viral\"\n\r\n\"Use these AI prompts to hack the algorithm\"\n\r\n\"Scale to 7 figures fast\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe teach:\n\r\n\"The world NEEDS what you've been hiding\"\n\r\n\"Purpose is a GIFT—you have a RESPONSIBILITY to shine\"\n\r\n\"Marketing isn't vanity, it's STEWARDSHIP\"\n\r\nWe extract clients' \"Voice DNA\" (using Enneagram psychology) FIRST, then calibrate AI to write in their authentic voice.\n\r\n\n\r\nTagline: \"We tune the signal before we amplify it.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role:\n\r\nI need someone who can:\n\r\n\n\r\nUnderstand nuanced concepts: Enneagram psychology, Voice DNA, transformation work, purpose-driven messaging\n\r\nWrite in a \"challenger\" tone: Direct, respectful, no fluff (NOT motivational guru style)\n\r\nWork FAST without sacrificing quality: 50-day sprint = tight deadlines\n\r\nBe coachable: I give detailed feedback, you iterate quickly\n\r\nThink strategically: Not just execute—help me see what's working/not working\n\r\nYour Target Avatar: \"The Invisible Expert\"\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be writing for solo practitioners who:\n\r\nAre brilliant at their craft (coaches, hypnotherapists, consultants)\n\r\nCan transform lives in one session\n\r\nHATE marketing (it feels icky, like selling out)\n\r\nLinkedIn = either totally silent OR sounds robotic when they try\n\r\n\n\r\nTheir Pain (7-Layer Invisibility Crisis):\n\r\nTried ChatGPT ? sounded robotic ? gave up\n\r\nPosted manually ? no engagement (didn't speak to PAIN) ? gave up\n\r\nProfile looks like 2012 CV ? no trust\n\r\nPost 3x/week ? 12 views ? algorithm buried them\n\r\nFlannel shirt selfie ? looks like hobbyist, not $5K expert\n\r\nCompetitors crush it with video ? don't know where to start\n\r\nKnow organic is dead ? LinkedIn Ads feel overwhelming\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Emotional Pain:\n\r\n\"I'm squandering my purpose by staying invisible. Someone out there needs what I offer and can't find me.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Write:\n\r\nWeek 1-2 (Launch Prep):\n\r\n7 LinkedIn posts (spiritual hooks, pain agitation, solution focus)\n\r\nSales page copy sections (hero, problem, solution, CTA)\n\r\n5\n nurture sequence\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 3-7 (Launch Phase):\n\r\n3 LinkedIn posts per week\n\r\nAd copy for LinkedIn Ads\n\r\nDM scripts for warm outreach\n\r\nSocial media captions (if needed)\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 8+ (Post-Launch):\n\r\n2-3 LinkedIn posts per week\n\r\nStudent testimonial/case study writeups\n\r\nModule descriptions for course content\n\r\nOngoing\n campaigns\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tone (CRITICAL to Understand):\n\r\nNOT:\n\r\n? Motivational coach: \"You can do this! Believe in yourself!\"\n\r\n? Corporate jargon: \"Leverage synergies for optimal outcomes\"\n\r\n? Guru-on-throne: \"I have the secrets, follow me\"\n\r\n\n\r\nIS:\n\r\n? Challenger: Respectful but direct (\"Here's the truth...\")\n\r\n?

GOOD:\n\r\n\"You tried ChatGPT. It sounded robotic. So you gave up.\n\r\nHere's why: Garbage in, garbage out.\n\r\nYou handed AI a blank slate. No context about your voice. No data about your psychological patterns.\n\r\nPi9 AI is different. We extract your Voice DNA FIRST—using the Enneagram (your psychological blueprint).\n\r\nTHEN we teach AI to write like YOU.\n\r\nNot louder. Not robotic.

They're not allowed to squander it.\n\r\nThey have a RESPONSIBILITY to shine—not for ego, but because someone out there is searching for exactly what they offer.\n\r\nMarketing isn't vanity.

Eliminate \"client drag\" by proactively chasing assets rather than waiting for them.\n\n\n\nAsset Collection: Secure the \"Emergency Water Damage Restoration Pack\" (photos, certifications, reviews) within 7 days of deposit. You must be comfortable pushing busy General Contractors to get what we need.\n\n\n\nQuality Assurance (The Gatekeeper): Rigorously perform the Website Quality Assurance Checklist. You are the final line of defense—zero broken links, \"dummy text,\" or mobile issues should ever slip through to the client presentation.\n\n\n\nClient Communication: Own the \"Friday Morning Update.\" Ensure 100% of active clients receive a status update every Friday, no exceptions. Translate technical jargon (DNS, Hosting) into simple business language.\n\n\n\nTeam Collaboration: Manage the \n board with impeccable accuracy. Ensure no project sits stagnant in a phase (Design/Dev) for more than 48 hours without movement or an update.\n\n\n\nLaunch & Testimonials: Lead the Launch Call with high energy to resell the client on the finished product. Secure a recorded Zoom Video Testimonial on the launch call (Target: >50% of clients).\n\n\n\nSkills & Tools Required:\n\n\n\nAssertive Diplomacy: Capable of pushing a busy contractor to send photos without being rude. You know how to be \"annoying\" in a way that the client respects to get the job done.\n\n\n\nMeticulous Eye: You spot a typo in a hero header from a mile away. You are obsessive about Quality Assurance.\n\n\n\nTech-Fluency: You don't need to be a coder, but you must understand the difference between a domain registrar and a DNS record.\n\n\n\nTool Proficiency: You are a wizard with \n, Slack, Loom, PandaDoc, and Zoom.\n\n\n\nProcess-Oriented: You don't \"wing it.\" You follow the 7-Phase SOP religiously to ensure consistency and avoid chaos later in the build.\n\n\n\nCompensation:\n\n\n\nThis is a performance-based role designed to reward efficiency and ownership.\n\n\n\nPay Structure: $1,000 per managed website launch (Estimated 15 hours + 5 hours buffer = ~$50/hr).\n\n\n\nPotential: $4,500 per month ($54,000/year) as you scale to full capacity (approx. 20 hours/week).\n\n\n\nNote: Hours may vary initially during the onboarding phase.\n\n\n\nWhy Join Us?\n\n\n\nWhen you look at our team, you’ll see a group of people \"rowing in the same boat\" who value extreme ownership and high standards.\n\n\n\nWe believe that setbacks are part of the journey and that pressure forms diamonds.\n\n\n\nYou will have autonomy, support, and the opportunity to make a genuine impact on families recovering from home disasters.\n\n\n\nIf you are ready to treat business like a sport, demand excellence, and refuse to hide behind excuses, we want to hear from you.\n\n\n\nReady to Join a Fast-Growing Team?\n\n\n\nIf you have the skills and experience to take on this crucial role, apply using the link below.\n\n\n\nAPPLY HERE:\n\n\n/build/\nNote: Applying directly on this form is the only way to confirm your application.

I will record all core videos myself. I am looking for a visual artist who can turn raw footage into short-form content that evokes awe, not just attention.\n\r\n\n\r\nClaude Monet is my favorite painter, and Yosemite is my favorite place on earth. Why? It's because both evoke wonder through light and scale. That sensibility matters here, even if the medium is radically different (video instead of paint or granite cliffs). \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you will do\n\r\n • Edit short-form videos (Reels / TikTok / Shorts) from weekly source recordings\n\r\n • Add captions, pacing, b-roll, and light motion graphics before cross-posting\n\r\n • Create clean, repeatable visual styles (typography, titles, lower thirds)\n\r\n • Cut and package highlights from my podcast appearances\n\r\n • Track and communicate performance metrics (views, retention, saves, shares), note patterns, and offer constructive feedback.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I provide\n\r\n • Weekly (stream-of-consciousness and/or scripted) source recordings\n\r\n • Some direction and fast feedback as you get started (with a goal that feedback is barely needed at all since you would be the vertical video artist) \n\r\n • Optional AI voice assets if ever needed \n\r\n • A simple, respectful revision process\n\r\n\n\r\nHOURS: Flexible. Start at 10–25 hours per week, with potential to grow.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY (READ CAREFULLY – APPLICATIONS ARE SCREENED FOR INSTRUCTION ACCURACY)\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that fail to meet any of the requirements below will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\n0. Title\n\r\n\n\r\nPut \"Hi, I'm [Name], and I'm your next Social Media Artist.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Portfolio (Links Only)\n\r\n\n\r\nProvide at least 7 short-form videos you personally edited.\n\r\nLinks must be viewable without requesting access.\n\r\nNo attachments. No uncurated folders.\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

References (Exactly Three)\n\r\n\n\r\nProvide three professional references, each with:\n\r\n • full name,\n\r\n • relationship to you,\n\r\n •\n address or WhatsApp number.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Written Reflection (Six Paragraphs)\n\r\n\n\r\nWrite three (3) whole paragraphs answering:\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat is awe-inspiring to you in the audio-visual arts?\n\r\n\n\r\nYou may reference painters, photographers, filmmakers, editors, or specific works. This is about taste, perception, and articulation. \n\r\n\n\r\nWrite three (3) whole paragraphs answering:\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat does the marriage of your artistic vision and technical prowess look like in action? \n\r\n\n\r\n5. Generative AI Disclosure\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude a section titled \"Generative AI Use\" stating:\n\r\n • whether you used AI in this application,\n\r\n • approximately how much (none / light / moderate / heavy),\n\r\n • what it was used for.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI is allowed, though not preferred, in the part about which is wondrous to you (because AI is not you). Honesty is required.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Other stuff\n\r\n\n\r\nAre you online anywhere I can find you? What else about you is interesting? What else might be relevant for this job?

    "description": "\n                    Job Description:\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe're a blockchain/DeFi company running production infrastructure that's bleeding money unnecessarily. Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you. Show us what you've done.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Sierra Sol Elevated Stays is a locally rooted, family-owned property management company serving Northern New Mexico (Santa Fe, Taos, Angel Fire, and Red River) with over 150 properties. Our love for this region is what led us to build Sierra Sol Elevated Stays, focused on providing elevated stays for our guests and elevated stewardship for our homeowners. Our goal is to grow in a way that celebrates what makes New Mexico special – its people, culture, and enchanted lands – while delivering elevated experiences for guests and thoughtful, reliable stewardship for homeowners.\n\r\n\n\r\nTech stack (daily tools): Guesty (PMS + guest inbox), Breezeway (tasks/workorders + cleaning), RingCentral (calls/SMS).\n\r\nOur Elevated Promises\n\r\n\n\r\nEverything we do is guided by our Elevated Promises. They are our operating standard and the way we earn five-star stays and trusted, long-term homeowner partnerships.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Elevated Guest Engagement: Proactive, elevated hospitality from booking to five-star review. \n\r\nWe believe vacations are special—something people save for, plan for, and look forward to. Our job is to make every stay feel seamless and memorable. We anticipate needs, communicate early, check in during the stay, and resolve issues quickly with warmth and care. Our guest journey is intentionally crafted to deliver the kind of responsiveness, thoughtfulness, and attention to detail that turns great trips into truly elevated experiences.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Elevated Home Stewardship: We care for every home as if it were our own.\n\r\nAs homeowners in these markets, we know what true home stewardship looks like. We operate with a proactive mindset of quality, consistency, and pride. Weekly home checks, rigorous cleaning standards, quality control, seasonal readiness, and preventive maintenance are all part of how we ensure every property is clean, protected, and presentation ready, for guests and for you. We treat every home with the same respect and diligence we expect for our own.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Elevated Homeowner Partnerships: We treat each home like our own investment.\n\r\nEvery homeowner has different goals – maximizing revenue, balancing personal use, focusing on long-term appreciation, or simply enjoying peace of mind. Our role is to be a true partner in those goals, not simply a property manager. As owners and operators in this region ourselves, our guidance comes from real-world results, not theory. Through regular business reviews, thoughtful design and amenity recommendations, revenue and pricing insights, and brand-building support, we help each property reach its highest potential.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Guest Experience team is one of the biggest ways we deliver these promises. This is hospitality work. You are a core part of our team, not an outsourced call-center function.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Description:\n\r\nAs a Guest Experience Virtual Assistant, you own guest communication and coordination. You are the voice of Sierra Sol, a core part of our team, and a key driver of five-star stays. You will manage guest messaging and calls, coordinate workorders and cleaning schedules with our local teams and vendors, and bring elevated hospitality and experiences to every stay.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will own:\n\r\n• Proactive outreach and warm guest engagement that drives five-star stays\n\r\n• Guest messaging and phone communication\n\r\n• Workorder coordination and task follow-through\n\r\n• Cleaning scheduling and day-to-day coordination with our local team and vendors\n\r\n\n\r\nWorking Hours\n\r\nWe provide live coverage from 7:00am to 11:00pm Mountain Time (MDT). You will be assigned a consistent shift. On-call after hour coverage (11:00pm-7:00am MDT) is handled by a separate rotation.\n\r\nMountain Daylight Time (MDT) ? Philippines Time (PHT):\n\r\n• 7am–3pm MDT ? 9pm–5am PHT\n\r\n• 11am–7pm MDT ? 1am–9am PHT\n\r\n• 3pm–11pm MDT ? 5am–1pm PHT\n\r\nYou will be assigned one shift. Overnight shifts include a differential.\n\r\nOn-call: 11pm–7am MDT is handled by an on-call rotation (separate from daily shift expectations).\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation and Incentives\n\r\n• Base pay: $650-$750 USD per month (full-time, based on experience)\n\r\n• Night shift (9p – 5a): +$50 per month\n\r\n• Internet/tech allowance: $20 per month\n\r\n• 13th month pay: offered in December (prorated for partial years)\n\r\n• Monthly Bonus: Monthly 5-Star Bonus Pool (based on team review quality + individual SLA performance)\n\r\n• PTO: Accrues at 1 paid days per month (usable after 90 days; no annual rollover)\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly 5-Star Bonus Pool\n\r\nWe keep the bonus simple, measurable, and tied directly to delivering elevated guest experiences — the heart of your role.\n\r\n• Pool funding: $2.00 USD for every 5-star review received during the month.\n\r\n• Quality gate: Pool funded only if the monthly average rating is 4.85+ and the review rate is 80%+.\n\r\n• Distribution: The funded pool is divided equally among the Guest Experience Tea\nmbers.\n\r\n• Eligibility: You receive your share when monthly SLA and performance standards are met.

We want her to try our Summit Skirted Legging. The tone must be \"warm, sophisticated, and eye-to-eye\"—not \"salesy\" or \"pushy.\"  I encourage you to read out \"About Us\" section - we need the creator to know we are more than just clothes and support our mission.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Strategy Question: If an affiliate is driving high traffic (clicks) but zero sales, what are the first three things you would investigate to \"right the ship\"?  \n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ANYAGE WEAR\n\r\nAnyAge Wear is a premium DTC apparel brand built for women 45+ who refuse to be \"invisible.\" We don’t chase trends; we build Confidence in Motion. Our hero products—like the Madison Long Jacket and the Summit Skirted Legging—are designed for real lives, real bodies, and real movement.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE\n\r\nWe are not looking for a data-entry clerk. We are looking for a CMO-minded Affiliate Manager who can build a bridge between our brand and the creators our audience trusts. You will own the strategy, recruitment, and management of our creator ecosystem.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\nEnd-to-End Creator Management: Identify, vet, and recruit high-alignment creators (Influencers, Bloggers, Community Leaders) who authentically represent the 45+ US woman.\n\r\n\n\r\nFB Creator Marketplace Mastery: Proactively navigate the\n Creator Marketplace to find and secure partnerships.\n\r\n\n\r\nDTC Performance Strategy: Manage the \"Value Ladder\"—moving creators from one-off gifted posts to long-term high-performing affiliates.\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand Stewardship: Ensure all creator content follows our Style Guide (Natural lighting, candid expressions, no \"overly romanticized\" or \"forced\" poses).\n\r\n\n\r\nApparel-Specific Growth: Use your knowledge of the apparel industry to highlight product utility (pockets, modesty, fabric tech) in creator briefs.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS\n\r\nDTC Apparel Experience: You must have worked with a US-based fashion or apparel brand. You understand sizing, fabric benefits, and the \"Style that Serves\" philosophy.\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh-Level Strategic Thinking: You understand ROAS, Attribution, and how to optimize a creator's performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nUS Cultural Nuance: You understand the lifestyle and values of the American woman 45+. You know the difference between \"influence\" and \"noise.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatform Expertise: Deep experience with affiliate tracking software (Impact, ShareASale, or similar) and Meta's new creator tool.\n\r\n\n\r\nFlawless Communication: Your written English is elegant, professional, and clear.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US?\n\r\nYou will be working directly with the founder of a brand that has a clear mission and soul..  We are looking for the best in the Philippines and can pay accordingly. If you are a strategist who wants to help scale a brand that actually matters to its customers, we want to talk to you.                ",

My name is Mel, and I own the top Christian speed-dating services in the United States! I’m on the lookout for a new assistant to grow with me. There are countless opportunities for growth, and I’m so excited to find the right person to join the team. I currently have two AMAZING assistants and need a third to keep up with the growth we've been experiencing. Here's a testimonial from one of my assistants:\n\r\n\n\r\n\"I’ve been working as Mel's VA since September 2024, and I genuinely love it. The work is meaningful (helping people find their Godly spouses), fast-paced, and never boring. You’re supporting a business that’s actively scaling. Mel is professional, clear, and respectful of boundaries. I can fully enjoy my days off, travel when needed, and never worry about work piling up. She also pays weekly and always on time. That said, a great client is great for a reason. This role requires great - truly GREAT - attention to detail. Mel has high standards, and rightfully so. If you’re not detail-oriented, proactive, and committed to doing excellent work, this won’t be the right fit. But if you are, working with her is incredibly fulfilling. I’m grateful to be part of her team and to support a leader who is clear, mission-driven, and genuinely good to work with.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease read carefully before applying\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not creative, not social-media strategy, and not “wing-it” work.\n\r\nThis role is for someone who genuinely enjoys:\n\r\n• Following detailed SOPs\n\r\n• Working from templates\n\r\n• Tracking numbers\n\r\n• Executing conditional logic accurately\n\r\n• Catching mistakes before they happen\n\r\n• Doing important but sometimes tedious admin work extremely well\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are not naturally obsessive about details, this role will feel overwhelming.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run highly organized, multi-city events with complex ticket logic, conditional\n workflows, and time-sensitive admin tasks. One small mistake can create downstream issues, so precision matters.
