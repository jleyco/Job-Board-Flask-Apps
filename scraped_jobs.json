    "description": "\n                    ABOUT ALL ANGLES CREATURES\n\r\nWe are a rapidly growing live feeder insect subscription company serving reptile and exotic pet owners across the United States. We ship hundreds of boxes weekly to subscribers nationwide and have experienced significant growth in our first year.\n\r\nOur customers aren’t just buying bugs - they’re caring for pets they’ll have for 10-20+ years. That means each customer relationship can span decades. Our entire business model depends on keeping customers happy, engaged, and subscribed for years.\n\r\nWe operate under the philosophy “Exotics Without Ego” - serving the reptile community authentically without pretension.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE\n\r\nWe need a Customer Service Manager who understands that in a subscription business, customer retention is everything. You’ll be responsible for building, training, and managing a small customer service team (2-4 people) that protects our most valuable asset: our subscriber base.\n\r\nThis is NOT a job where you just process tickets and check boxes. This is a leadership role where you’ll be measured on whether customers stay with us or leave us.\n\r\nYour primary responsibility: Make sure every customer interaction either maintains or strengthens the relationship - never damages it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\r\nTeam Leadership:\n\r\n ? Hire, train, and manage 2-4 customer service representatives\n\r\n ? Establish quality standards and hold your team accountable to them\n\r\n ? Review team performance daily and provide real-time coaching\n\r\n ? Make difficult decisions including firing underperformers when necessary\n\r\n ? Coach in real-time when you see responses that miss the mark\n\r\nCustomer Retention:\n\r\n ? Ensure every customer complaint is handled in a way that de-escalates frustration\n\r\n ? Monitor retention metrics and identify patterns in customer churn\n\r\n ? Have authority to make decisions that solve problems quickly (refunds, credits, replacements)\n\r\n ? Understand that protecting customer relationships is protecting revenue\n\r\nOperations & Systems:\n\r\n ? Create and maintain standardized response templates (macros) for common issues\n\r\n ? Manage customer service platforms (Shopify,\n, potentially Gorgias or similar)\n\r\n ? Track key metrics: response time, resolution time, customer satisfaction, retention impact\n\r\n ? Identify operational issues that cause customer complaints and escalate them\n\r\n ? Operate independently without requiring daily direction\n\r\nCommunication:\n\r\n ? Provide daily updates on critical customer issues\n\r\n ? Weekly reporting on team performance and retention metrics\n\r\n ? Be direct and honest when things aren’t working - no excuses, just solutions\n\r\n ? Handle direct feedback without becoming defensive\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR\n\r\nNon-Negotiable Requirements:\n\r\n ? 3+ years managing remote customer service teams (we need proven leadership, not someone learning on the job)\n\r\n ? E-commerce experience required (Shopify experience strongly preferred)\n\r\n ? Subscription business experience (you must understand retention economics)\n\r\n ? Excellent written English (native or near-native level - our customers need to feel heard and understood)\n\r\n ? Experience handling angry/frustrated customers (you know how to de-escalate, not inflame)\n\r\n ? Proven ability to hire and fire (you must have actually terminated underperformers)\n\r\nPersonality & Approach:\n\r\n ? Direct and honest - no sugarcoating, no excuses, just facts and solutions\n\r\n ? Accountable - you own results, not explanations for why results didn’t happen\n\r\n ? Decisive - you can make tough calls (including firing people) without hesitation\n\r\n ? Customer-obsessed - you understand that unhappy customers destroy subscription businesses\n\r\n ? Coachable - you can take direct feedback and adjust immediately\n\r\n ? Comfortable with confrontation - you don’t avoid difficult conversations\n\r\n ? Results-oriented - you care about outcomes, not just being busy\n\r\nBonus Points:\n\r\n ? Experience with live animal or perishable product shipping\n\r\n ? Background in communities/forums (Reddit,\n groups, etc.)\n\r\n ? Familiarity with reptile/exotic pet industry\n\r\n ? Experience with Gorgias, Zendesk, or similar CS platforms\n\r\n ? Track record of improving retention metrics in previous roles\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE IN THIS ROLE\n\r\nFirst 30 Days:\n\r\n ? Build and train a 2-3 person CS team from scratch\n\r\n ? Establish response templates and quality standards\n\r\n ? Demonstrate your team can de-escalate angry customers (not make them angrier)\n\r\n ? Show measurable improvement in customer satisfaction\n\r\n ? Handle urgent issues independently without waiting for approval\n\r\nFirst 90 Days:\n\r\n ? Customer retention rate improving month-over-month\n\r\n ? Complaint escalations decreasing\n\r\n ? Response quality consistently high across all tea\nmbers\n\r\n ? Clear systems in place for handling common issues\n\r\n ? Team operating smoothly with minimal daily oversight from you\n\r\nLong-term:\n\r\n ? Customer service becomes a competitive advantage, not a liability\n\r\n ? Customers actively praise our service in community forums\n\r\n ? Retention metrics show we’re keeping customers for years, not months\n\r\n ? You’ve built a self-managing team that maintains standards without constant supervision\n\r\n ? You can identify and fix problems before they become crises\n\r\n\n\r\nDECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY\n\r\nYou will have authority to:\n\r\n ? Approve refunds and credits up to reasonable amounts\n\r\n ? Offer shipping upgrades or compensation to resolve issues\n\r\n ? Add extra product to shipments when needed\n\r\n ? Make judgment calls on customer situations without seeking approval for every decision\n\r\n ? Hire and terminate tea\nmbers based on performance\n\r\nWe need a manager who can ACT, not someone who asks permission for everything.\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION & BENEFITS\n\r\n ? Salary: Competitive rate based on experience and performance\n\r\n ? Performance-based increases: As retention metrics improve, your compensation can too\n\r\n ? Growth opportunity: As AAC grows, this role can expand in scope and compensation\n\r\n ? Autonomy: You’ll have real authority to make decisions and build your team your way\n\r\n ? Payment: Via PayPal or Wise, reliable and on-time\n\r\n\n\r\nOUR CULTURE & VALUES\n\r\n ? Honesty over politeness - we’d rather hear hard truths than comfortable lies\n\r\n ? Results over activity - we measure outcomes, not hours worked\n\r\n ? Customers are relationships, not transactions - each one represents years of potential revenue\n\r\n ? No ego, just service - we exist to serve reptile keepers authentically\n\r\n ? Accountability - we own our mistakes and fix them fast\n\r\n ? Direct communication - we value clarity and honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable\n\r\n ? Action over analysis - we fix problems, we don’t just explain them\n\r\n\n\r\nRED FLAGS (Please don’t apply if this is you):\n\r\n ? You make excuses when things go wrong instead of owning problems\n\r\n ? You avoid difficult conversations or decisions\n\r\n ? You need extensive hand-holding or daily direction\n\r\n ? You prioritize process over results\n\r\n ? You can’t handle direct feedback without getting defensive\n\r\n ? You think customer service is just about being polite (it’s about retention)\n\r\n ? You’ve never actually fired anyone\n\r\n ? You need consensus before making decisions\n\r\n ? You analyze problems more than you solve them\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nThis application process will take 2-3 hours to complete properly. If you’re not willing to invest that time, please don’t apply.\n\r\nStep 1: Submit your application through OnlineJobs.ph\n\r\nStep 2: In your cover letter, answer ALL of these questions. Applications without complete, thoughtful answers will be automatically rejected:\n\r\nQUESTION 1 - Leadership & Accountability:\n\r\nTell me about a time you had to fire someone on your team. What led to that decision and how did you handle it? (If you’ve never fired anyone, explain why and whether you’d be capable of doing it.)\n\r\nQUESTION 2 - De-escalation Skills:\n\r\nA customer\ns: “I just got my dubia roaches and half of them are DEAD. This is the second time this happened. I’m canceling my subscription and telling everyone in my reptile group to avoid you.”\n\r\nWrite the EXACT response you would send to this customer right now.\n\r\nQUESTION 3 - Coaching Ability:\n\r\nHere’s how one of our agents responded to an angry customer:\n\r\n“Hi, I understand you’re frustrated with the issue. Unfortunately, due to system limitations, processing your refund requires a handoff to another department. We’re working on improving our processes. Your credit should reflect soon, though there may be display issues on your end. Let me know if you have questions!”\n\r\nAnswer these three parts:\n\r\n(a) What’s wrong with this response?\n\r\n(b) What should the agent have said instead? (Write the actual response)\n\r\n(c) How would you coach this agent to prevent this in the future?\n\r\nQUESTION 4 - Subscription Economics:\n\r\nExplain why losing 10% of subscribers in a subscription business is different from losing 10% of customers in a regular e-commerce store. What does this mean for how you manage customer service?\n\r\nQUESTION 5 - Decision Making Under Pressure:\n\r\nYou notice your team’s response times are slipping and customer satisfaction scores are dropping. I’m unreachable for the next 3 days. Walk me through exactly what you do, hour by hour for the first day.\n\r\nQUESTION 6 - Metrics & Measurement:\n\r\nWhat are the top 3 metrics you track for customer service in a subscription business and why? How do you know if your team is actually protecting customer relationships vs. just processing tickets?\n\r\nQUESTION 7 - Handling Being Wrong:\n\r\nTell me about a time you made a decision you were confident in, and your boss told you that you were completely wrong. What happened next?\n\r\nQUESTION 8 - Ownership vs. Excuses:\n\r\nYour team missed retention targets this month. I ask you: “Why did we lose more customers than usual this month?” Give me your answer right now.\n\r\nQUESTION 9 - Crisis Management:\n\r\nA customer calls you a scammer and threatens to report you to the BBB. Your agent responded by getting defensive and made it worse. The customer is now posting in\n groups calling you a scam company. What do you do in the next 60 minutes? Be specific - give me your action plan step by step.\n\r\nQUESTION 10 - Direct Communication:\n\r\nI tell you: “Your team sucks at de-escalating customers and if it doesn’t improve this week, I’m firing everyone including you.”\n\r\nHow do you respond to me? (Write your actual response)\n\r\nQUESTION 11 - Fast Start:\n\r\nYou start Monday morning. By Friday end of day, you need to have hired 2 CS reps and handled a backlog of 50 angry customer\ns while your new hires are training. Walk me through your week - what happens Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday?\n\r\nStep 3: Provide the following:\n\r\n ? Your LinkedIn profile or professional portfolio (if you have one)\n\r\n ? At least 2 professional references with contact information (preferably former supervisors or people you managed)\n\r\n ? Any examples of customer service training materials, macros, or SOPs you’ve created\n\r\n ? Screenshots or examples of customer service metrics/dashboards you’ve tracked or built\n\r\n ? Your\n ID or preferred video call platform for interviews\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT GREAT ANSWERS LOOK LIKE:\n\r\n ? Specific, not generic - “I did X which resulted in Y” not “I believe in good customer service”\n\r\n ? Honest about challenges - You admit what’s hard, not just what you’re good at\n\r\n ? Action-oriented - You focus on what you DID, not what you thought about\n\r\n ? Numbers-driven - You mention metrics, results, improvements\n\r\n ? No jargon - You explain things clearly without hiding behind corporate buzzwords\n\r\n ? Ownership mentality - You say “I” not “we” when talking about your decisions\n\r\n\n\r\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\r\n 1. Application review (2-3 days) - We’ll carefully review your answers to all 11 questions\n\r\n 2. Video interview (45-60 minutes) - Deep dive into your experience, management philosophy, and how you handle real situations\n\r\n 3. Practical assessment (90 minutes) - You’ll review real customer complaints from our actual inbox and show us:\n\r\n ? How you’d respond to each\n\r\n ? How you’d coach the team\n\r\n ? What systems you’d put in place\n\r\n 4. Reference check (1-2 days) - We’ll speak with your references\n\r\n 5. Final decision (1 day) - We move fast; if you’re the right fit, you could start within 1-2 weeks\n\r\nTotal timeline: 7-10 days from application to decision\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n\r\n ? We value your time - if you invest 2-3 hours in a thoughtful application, we’ll give you detailed feedback even if you’re not selected\n\r\n ? We’re looking for ONE person, not multiple - this is a direct hire, not a pool\n\r\n ? We will check your references thoroughly\n\r\n ? We expect honesty - if you exaggerate or lie in your application, we will find out\n\r\n ? The work starts immediately - there’s no long onboarding or “settling in” period\n\r\n\n\r\nREADY TO APPLY?\n\r\nThis is a real leadership opportunity with a fast-growing company. We’re not looking for someone who needs their hand held. We’re looking for someone who can see a problem, own it, fix it, and build a team that prevents it from happening again.\n\r\nIf you understand that customer retention is the lifeblood of subscription businesses, if you can build and lead a team that protects customer relationships, and if you can handle direct communication without getting defensive - we want to hear from you.\n\r\nApply now through OnlineJobs.ph.\n\r\nDO NOT apply if you’re not willing to answer all 11 questions thoroughly.
