    "description": "\n                    About nutrition.fitness\n\r\nnutrition.fitness is a comprehensive SaaS platform and mobile application that integrates training programmes, nutrition, and educational content into a single, cohesive system. It is specifically designed to serve both individuals and coaches who value structure and guidance, moving away from generic plans and disconnected applications.\n\r\nIntegrated Training and Nutrition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe platform provides users with guided workouts and macro-based nutrition planning, including meal preparation guidance. All features are underpinned by a robust onboarding process, ensuring that targets are not arbitrary. Instead, calorie, macro, and programme settings are determined by each user's goals, training regime, and lifestyle. This synergy means that training and nutrition are directly connected: as users progress through workouts, their calorie requirements and food logging targets are updated daily. This dynamic approach allows users to clearly see what has changed in their plan and understand the reasons behind those adjustments.\n\r\n\n\r\nnutrition.fitness offers a range of innovative features, including AI-powered coaching, fridge and plate scanning for meal tracking, and comprehensive tracking for both food and supplements. Built-in educational resources are also available to help users deepen their understanding. The platform's aim is not to replace the decision-making process, but to reduce friction and support users in understanding their actions as they progress.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe service is accessible as both a web application and a mobile app, providing visibility and management tools for coaches and administrators. Every component of the platform is intentionally designed to work together, supporting users in achieving long-term results and sustained engagement, rather than offering short-lived hype.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Actually Do \n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be responsible for two main areas:\n\r\n\n\r\nGoHighLevel\n\r\n\n\r\n• Ensure the platform is set up properly, not just partially functional or left for future tidying.\n\r\n• Guarantee that funnels are live and automations are running smoothly.\n\r\n• Connect forms and calendars, ensuring pipelines are logical and understandable by others.\n\r\n• Prioritise simplicity; if something is clever but confusing, it’s incorrect.\n\r\n\n\r\nWordPress + Elementor\n\r\n\n\r\n• Improve the website’s appearance, making it clearer, more confident, and avoiding the impression of a hastily built site.\n\r\n• We are talking header front page and footer and theme. Some page templates if needed.\n\r\n• Design skills are not mandatory, but having taste, sound judgement, and the willingness to fix poor visuals is essential.\n\r\n• Use Canva as needed to enhance pages and funnels, avoiding unnecessary over-design.\n\r\n• Outcomes will be specified; you d\n on the best approach to achieve them.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow We Work (Important)\n\r\n\n\r\n• This is a relaxed role as long as deliverables are met.\n\r\n• Work hours, duration, and location are flexible.\n\r\n• What matters is that tasks are completed, functions work, and systems are tidy.\n\r\n• Thinking, delivering, and communicating will earn support.\n\r\n• If you encounter challenges, ask for help.\n\r\n• If you notice issues, take initiative to fix them.\n\r\n• If you have better ideas, share them.\n\r\n• Using your brain is central to this position.\n\r\n• We make each other’s lives easier.\n\r\n• Don’t give details, give deliverables that make me go wow.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe First Month (“Get Shit Done” Trial)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis position begins with a one-month trial period focused on results:\n\r\n• By the end of the month, High-level should be set up and functional.\n\r\n• Funnels and automations must be live.\n\r\n• The website should have a noticeably stronger look and feel.\n\r\n• The aim is to have systems set up and working not perfect, not endlessly tweaked.\n\r\nSuccess leads to collective rewards and the opportunity for the role to expand long-term. There are no empty promises results lead to tangible benefits.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply \n\r\n\n\r\n• Do not send a polished cover letter, a CV full of jargon, or anything generated by AI these are instant rejections.\n\r\n• Instead, visit nutrition.fitness and share your honest thoughts: what is confusing, what is weak, and what you would change first if it were your product. If you don’t understand that’s intentional.\n\r\n• Describe your approach to the first month: how you would set up GoHighLevel, where you would focus, and what you would deliberately leave alone for now.\n\r\n• Explain what “owning a role” means to you in practical terms give a real example, not a quote or slogan.\n\r\n• Rough writing, bullet points, and imperfect English are acceptable even a video - clear thinking is mandatory.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal Reality Check\n\r\n\n\r\n• This role offers autonomy, trust, support, and the chance to build something you can be proud of.\n\r\n• Delivery is key success depends on getting things done.\n\r\n• If this makes you nervous, good! If this excites you, apply. If you find these expectations bothersome, don’t fucking apply. \n\r\n\n\r\nThat’s it plain and simple                ",
