    "description": "\n                    Who We Are -----\n\r\n\n\r\nAt Private Practice Elevation, we imagine a world where every private practice owner can reach the clients they love, expand their impact, and build the business and life of their dreams.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe do that through website design and development, SEO services, and by being a team that clients can trust to help them elevate their online presence.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur ideal clients are mental health therapists who are building a group private practice or solo therapists who need a killer website to stand out and take their business to the next level. \n\r\n\n\r\nTypically, they struggle a bit with all this technical stuff, so we serve as their guide to help them succeed with their online marketing.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We're Looking For -----\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for a detail-oriented Website Designer to join our growing remote team.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour main job will be to take raw materials — like copy, brand colors, and photos — and turn them into beautiful, thoughtful website designs that reflect our clients’ vision. \n\r\n\n\r\nWhile we’ve historically used Figma for web design, we’re open to other tools or platforms — especially those that speed up the design process or improve developer handoff. Whether it’s Figma, Adobe XD, AI-assisted tools like Stitch, or something else — the key is that your designs are clean, thoughtful, and ready for WordPress implementation.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should have experience collaborating with developers and an eye for practical, functional design, not just what looks good, but what works smoothly once built.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re also looking for someone who’s not just creative, but process-minded. If you’re the type of person who enjoys improving systems and making things run more efficiently, you’ll thrive here. We’ve got a solid design process in place, but we’re always open to better ways of doing things.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile this role doesn’t require direct client communication, you should be comfortable taking feedback from both clients (via our internal team) and tea\nmbers, and quickly translating it into design updates that reflect the client’s vision and goals.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, we’d love to see you grow with us — taking on more ownership, helping lead design initiatives, and contributing to the overall vision of the agency.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll report to the agency owner (Daniel), with day-to-day coordination and support from our Project Manager.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a remote contractor position. While our USA team works between 9 AM and 5 PM ET, you’ll have flexibility to set your own hours — as long as you’re reliably available to collaborate and meet project timelines. This position will start with 10-15 hours/week with room to grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Outcomes -----\n\r\n\n\r\nThe purpose of this role is to ensure that website design projects are completed on time (or faster), with high quality and clear communication — all while helping our clients feel supported and confident in the process.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following is how we’ll measure your success:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Design projects stay 90% on track or better, with deliverables completed on time and aligned with the overall project timeline\n\r\n\n\r\n• Client feedback is consistently incorporated quickly and accurately, resulting in high client satisfaction and minimal revision cycles\n\r\n\n\r\n• Designs are developer-ready, requiring little to no clarification at handoff and translating smoothly into WordPress builds\n\r\n\n\r\n• The design process becomes more efficient over time, with noticeable improvements in turnaround speed and fewer bottlenecks\n\r\n\n\r\nI• nternal design systems and processes are maintained or improved, helping the team scale, reduce repetitive work, and maintain consistency across projects\n\r\n\n\r\nAreas of Responsibility -----\n\r\n\n\r\nBelow are typical tasks you’ll be responsible for. These may evolve as the role grows, but your main focus is achieving the outcomes above — not just completing a checklist.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Manage your design tasks daily via Asana to stay aligned with team deadlines\n\r\n• Interpret design briefs and understand client needs, goals, and visual direction\n\r\n• Create website designs in Figma or Similar Platforms that are aesthetically strong, user-friendly, and developer-ready\n\r\n• Build and maintain component libraries or design systems to streamline workflow and ensure consistency\n\r\n• Prepare and package design files for seamless developer handoff, including notes on interactivity, responsiveness, and functionality\n\r\n• Collaborate with our team through Slack, weekly meetings, and project kickoffs\n\r\n• Respond promptly to feedback from the internal team or client, making updates quickly and accurately\n\r\n• Source stock photography that enhances designs and fits project goals\n\r\n• Perform quick design QA checks to ensure final WordPress builds match the original design\n\r\n• Look for opportunities to improve internal design processes, templates, or systems\n\r\n• Stay current with web design trends, accessibility practices, and UX best practices\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a remote contractor position with flexible hours. While you can set your own schedule, we expect reliable daily communication and availability for team collaboration.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere are some examples of the type of work we create: \n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not just looking for people who want to pick up some extra work, but for team-players who want to play an active role in the development of our business for the long term.\n\r\n\n\r\nSystems we use:\n\r\nAsana\n\r\nWordPress\n\r\nSlack\n\r\nGoogle Drive / Docs\n\r\n\n\r\nIf This Sounds Like You, We Want to Hear From You -----\n\r\n\n\r\n• You take pride in your work and care deeply about the quality and impact of what you create — from the smallest design detail to the overall user experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n• You’re motivated by helping others succeed, and you see each project as an opportunity to serve our clients well and support their mission.\n\r\n\n\r\n• You’re highly detailed and dependable — the kind of person who consistently delivers polished work without needing to be micromanaged.\n\r\n\n\r\n• You’re proactive and resourceful, often spotting design or process gaps before they become problems.\n\r\n\n\r\n• You enjoy collaborating with a team and can take feedback with a positive, growth-minded attitude.\n\r\n\n\r\n• You’re organized and self-motivated, able to manage your own deadlines and tasks in tools like Asana and Slack.\n\r\n\n\r\n• You’re always looking for ways to streamline the design process, reduce turnaround time, and improve how things get done.\n\r\n\n\r\n• You’re comfortable using AI to increase your speed and efficiency\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements -----\n\r\n\n\r\n• 2–5 years of experience designing websites professionally\n\r\n\n\r\n• Proficiency in modern website design tools (Figma, Adobe XD, or AI-assisted platforms like Stitch) — ability to create developer-ready, responsive designs is more important than the specific tool you use.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Strong understanding of web design best practices, user experience, and how to design for responsive layouts\n\r\n\n\r\n• Experience designing websites that are developer-friendly, with clean handoffs and attention to functionality and layout consistency\n\r\n\n\r\n• Familiarity with WordPress and how design translates to front-end development — no coding required, but you understand the basics\n\r\n\n\r\n• Strong communication skills and comfort receiving and incorporating feedback\n\r\n\n\r\n• Excellent time management and self-organization in a remote work setting\n\r\n\n\r\n• Bonus: Experience designing for the mental health, wellness, or service-based industries\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSo…\n\r\n• Would you like opportunities to impact the growth of our business as well as the businesses of our clients?\n\r\n• Would you like a job that encourages growth professionally and personally?\n\r\n• Would you like to work in a company that seeks to serve its clients above all else?\n\r\n\n\r\nHere’s how to apply -----\n\r\n\n\r\nFill out our application form in full to be considered. Somewhere in the application, let us know the best gift you’ve ever received:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \n\r\n\n\r\nThank you!                ",

Let performance do the talking\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Performance Ads for Meta (FB/IG)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Build direct response–style video ads that sell\n\r\n- Add CTAs, motion graphics, and overlays that enhance without overwhelming\n\r\n- Test, learn, adapt — fast\n\r\n- Minimum Output (To Start):\n\r\n- 5 Social Reels per week\n\r\n- 5 Video Ads per week\n\r\n(This will grow if you impress.)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Tools:\n\r\nAdobe Premiere Pro / Final Cut / After Effects or equivalent\n\r\nMotion graphics skills (even light ones) are a big plus\n\r\nBonus if you’re experimenting with AI, CapCut, or other trend-forward tools\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy You’ll Love This:\n\r\n- You’ll work with an emerging premium jewelry brand built by people who respect art and performance\n\r\n- No fluff.

    "description": "\n                    Most video editor jobs?\n\r\n\n\r\nThey burn you out in 6 months. Endless revisions. Micromanagement. Different creative directors every week with different \"visions.\" Then you're looking for the next gig.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't that.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have 2 video editors who've been with us for over 3 years. Our average employment? Around 3 years.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy? Because if you're performing and growing as we grow—this is one of the most stable, rewarding video editor roles you'll find in e-commerce.\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me be clear about what we're building here:\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is TheraPet. We're a fast-growing pet brand. And we need a Video Editor who understands direct response, AI-generated visuals, and most importantly—footage selection.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe editing part? Not complicated.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut choosing the right footage, the right hook, the right visual that works with the text on screen? That's where we need you to be the best.\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery visual should speak the same story. The hook should match the message. The visuals should reinforce what the copy says. Everything should align—from the first frame to the landing page.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's the skill we're hiring for.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what makes this different:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou own your work — Our senior video editor supervises you for the first few months. After that? You're autonomous. You work in a small pod with 2 strategists. No revolving door of people. No chaos.\n\r\n\n\r\nFlexible schedule — Task-based. You manage your time. We expect around 5 hours/day of focused work. One meeting per week max. No exhausting Zoom marathons.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe value speed and learning — You execute fast. You're constantly learning. You stay curious. That's the culture.\n\r\n\n\r\nInstant communication — We expect quick Slack responses. But that's it. No micromanagement. Just clarity and speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe compensation (let's talk numbers):\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Salary: $1,500–$2,000/month (based on your current skills)\n\r\n\n\r\nQuarterly Bonus: $1,000–$2,000 (performance-based)\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Leave\n\r\n\n\r\nInsurance (covered after 6 months with us)\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd here's the best part: As you grow, your salary grows. This isn't a dead-end role. It's a career.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we're looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\n2+ years editing for e-commerce brands (preferably 3+)\n\r\n\n\r\nDeep understanding of direct response ads — hooks, pacing, retention psychology\n\r\n\n\r\nAI video skills are a HUGE plus (Veo 3, Sora, Runway) — if you don't know them yet, we'll teach you\n\r\n\n\r\nExcellence in footage selection — this is where the magic happens\n\r\n\n\r\nConstant learner mindset — you don't settle, you improve\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYour day-to-day:\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing scroll-stopping ads for Meta, TikTok, YouTube\n\r\nSourcing or generating AI shots (hooks, UGC-style clips, product visuals)\n\r\nCombining real footage + AI assets to create performance-driven creatives\n\r\nCollaborating with strategists on new angles and concepts\n\r\nNo fluff. No busywork. Just high-impact creative work.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy people stay with us:\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause we don't just hire and forget. We invest in you. We give you freedom, stability, and growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur video editors don't leave because there's nowhere better to go. They stay because this is the better place.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nAnswer this question (we only review applications that include this):\n\r\n\n\r\n1.
