Unlike conventional products, Rael products are toxin-free, chlorine-free, fragrance-free, and hypoallergenic—without ever compromising on quality, comfort, or performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nFounded in 2017 in Southern California by three Korean American women with distinct backgrounds—a journalist and bestselling author, a former Disney movie distributor with a Harvard MBA, and an architect-turned-art director—Rael began with organic cotton cover pads and quickly became the #1 pad brand on Amazon. Today, we’ve expanded into clean feminine care, feminine wellness supplements, and skincare inspired by K-beauty innovation, including pimple patches, facial sheet masks, and everyday skincare essentials. We’re also proud to be the #2 pimple patch brand on Amazon.\n\r\n\n\r\nRael products are sold at Amazon, \n, Target, Ulta Beauty, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Sprouts, and more. Our brand has been recognized across the industry, earning honors such as Wellness Brand of the Year (Glossy), Best Use of TikTok (Glossy), and multiple best-in-class beauty awards from Allure, Cosmopolitan, and Good Housekeeping, among others. Our CEO has also been recognized as an Entrepreneur of the Year by EY, reflecting Rael’s strong leadership and continued growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nRael was named to the Inc. 5000 list in both 2023 and 2024, celebrating the fastest-growing private companies in America, and has grown into a globally recognized brand with a branch office in Seoul, Korea. We’re also proud to be the most-followed and fastest-growing feminine care brand on TikTok, and a top women’s wellness brand trusted and loved by thousands of beauty and wellness influencers.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’re passionate about making a meaningful impact, thrive in a fast-paced environment, and want to help shape the future of women’s health and wellness, we’d love for you to join us.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Summary:\n\r\nWe’re looking for a passionate and diligent Graphic Designer to join our creative team at Rael, reporting to the Creative Director. The person for this role possesses the ability to work hands-on, conceptually as well as practically. You will work closely with our Senior Graphic Designer and Creative Director on digital projects, focused on executing graphic design for our Amazon business.

It requires curiosity, critical thinking, and the ability to explain things simply. If you enjoy researching, comparing options, and turning complex information into clear guidance, this role is a great fit.\n\r\n?\n\r\nResponsibilities\n\r\n????

Content Creation\n\r\n• Write clear, polished descriptions for publication on our website\n\r\n• Translate technical or confusing features into plain English contractors understand\n\r\n• Organize content consistently so contractors can quickly answer:\n\r\n• “Is this for me?”\n\r\n• “Is this worth the cost?”\n\r\n?\n\r\n????

Health Insurance – Medical Stipend Program\n\r\nWe provide a Medical Stipend Program that allows you to choose the health insurance plan that best fits your needs.\n\r\nWhy this is better than a one-size-fits-all HMO:\n\r\n• Choose a plan that fits you or your family\n\r\n• Select coverage that works with hospitals and clinics near you\n\r\n• Customize medical, dental, and vision coverage\n\r\nProgram Details:\n\r\n• Up to 100,000 PHP per year toward your health insurance premium\n\r\n• Eligible after 90 days of employment\n\r\n• Annual premium is divided into weekly payments and added to your paycheck\n\r\n• You may add beneficiaries, as long as total premiums stay within the allowance\n\r\n• If your chosen plan exceeds the allowance, you simply cover the difference\n\r\n?\n\r\n?????

    "description": "\n                    Overview\n\r\n\n\r\nI am hiring an experienced AI video creator to produce a short, horizontal animated advertisement (20 to 30 seconds). The concept is an ultrasound \nnt that transitions into a fast montage of a child’s future life \nnts, ending with on screen text: “FREE ULTRASOUND.”\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not basic prompting. I need someone who can maintain character consistency, match a clean Pixar style cartoon look, generate multiple scenes, animate them smoothly, and edit into one polished clip.\n\r\n\n\r\nStyle Reference\n\r\n\n\r\n- The style is a warm, high quality 3D cartoon look similar to the reference discussed in the\n thread.\n\r\n\n\r\nVideo Specs\n\r\n\n\r\n- Orientation: Horizontal (landscape) for future use on large displays (billboards).\n\r\n- Length: 20 to 30 seconds total.\n\r\n- Deliverable: One final MP4 video file.\n\r\n\n\r\nScene Scope (what needs to be shown)\n\r\n\n\r\nThe core sequence is:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Doctor touches mother’s belly while ultrasound is being done.\n\r\n- Transition into a montage of the child’s future, similar to the referenced stork style ad but with the doctor and ultrasound concept.\n\r\n\n\r\nExample montage \nnts requested (I have example scenes):\n\r\n\n\r\n- Childhood \nnts like dad reading a story, mom teaching the child to write, riding a bike with dad.\n\r\n- Kid sports \nnt (soccer).\n\r\n- Teen stage (visually older than the child scenes).\n\r\n- Graduation.\n\r\n- Career \nnt (welder or office job type scene).\n\r\n- Marriage (wedding).\n\r\n- End card text: FREE ULTRASOUND.\n\r\n\n\r\nCharacter notes:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Keep the same main child consistent across scenes.\n\r\n- Show clear age progression (younger child, older kid, teen, adult).\n\r\n- One scene may include mom holding a baby.\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing notes:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Smooth transitions.\n\r\n- Backgrounds can be simpler if it helps transitions look cleaner.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools and Skills Required\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have real experience creating coherent multi scene videos with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Kling, Sora, Veo (or equivalent high end AI video tools)\n\r\n- Ability to keep character identity consistent across multiple shots\n\r\n- AI image generation plus animation workflow when needed\n\r\n- Video editing skills to assemble scenes, control pacing, and add final text\n\r\n- If you have access to the tools, great. If needed, I may provide access to certain tools depending on the candidate.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I Will Provide: \n\r\n\n\r\n- The full concept and scene list\n\r\n- Style guidance and references\n\r\n- Feedback on drafts\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliverables\n\r\n\n\r\n- First draft: full 20 to 30 second clip with all scenes in order\n\r\n- Final version after revisions (see below)\n\r\n- Source assets or project files if applicable (optional, tell me what you can provide)\n\r\n\n\r\nRevisions\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude 2 rounds of revisions:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Round 1: scene timing, transitions, character consistency\n\r\n- Round 2: final polish and end card text\n\r\n\n\r\nPay Structure\n\r\n\n\r\nChoose one option in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\nOption A: Fixed price for the full clip\n\r\nOption B: Hourly rate with a not to exceed cap (example: 2 to 4 hours for an experienced operator)\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (must answer these):\n\r\n\n\r\n- What AI video tools do you actively use (Kling, Sora, Veo, others)?\n\r\n- Share 2 to 3 examples of AI animated videos you have made (links required).\n\r\n- Describe your workflow for character consistency across scenes.\n\r\n- Estimate hours needed for a 20 to 30 second multi scene montage like this.\n\r\n- What is your rate: hourly and fixed price?

    "description": "\n                    Our Guest Experience Manager leads the heart of our hospitality operation. You coach and support our Guest Experience Virtual Agents, champion our elevated standards, and ensure every guest and homeowner interaction reflects the warmth, attentiveness, and care Sierra Sol Elevated Stays is known for.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll oversee daily workflows, maintain quality across all communication channels, lead escalations with empathy and confidence, and help shape a culture of hospitality excellence. This is a leadership role for someone who thrives in a fast-paced environment and takes pride in creating elevated experiences for guests and homeowners.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are a core part of our team, not an outsourced call center supervisor. Your leadership brings our Elevated Promises to life every day.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Guest Experience team will own:\n\r\n• Proactive outreach and warm guest engagement that drives five-star stays\n\r\n• Guest messaging and phone communication\n\r\n• Workorder coordination and task follow-through\n\r\n• Cleaning scheduling and day-to-day coordination with our local team and vendors\n\r\n\n\r\nWorking Hours\n\r\nOur Guest Experience team will provide live coverage from 7:00am to 11:00pm Mountain Time (MDT), 9:00pm to 1:00pm Philippines Time (PHT). Each tea\nmber will be assigned a consistent shift. On-call after-hour coverage (11:00pm-7:00am MDT) will be handled by an on-call rotation (separate from daily shift expectations).\n\r\n\n\r\nAs the leader for the Guest Experience team, you will work a consistent schedule aligned to our coverage windows (7:00am-11:00pm MDT) and be available for escalations during peak periods and coverage during tea\nmber PTO. We will set your core hours based on the final team schedule.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation and Incentives (Direct Hire)\n\r\n• Base pay: $900-$1,100 USD per month (full-time, based on experience, leadership capability, and hospitality/STR background)\n\r\n• Internet/tech allowance: $20 per month\n\r\n• 13th month pay: Provided in December (prorated for partial years)\n\r\n• Monthly Bonus: Monthly 5-Star Bonus Pool (based on team review quality + individual SLA performance)\n\r\n• PTO: Accrues at 1.25 paid days per month (usable after 90 days; no annual rollover)\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly 5-Star Bonus Pool\n\r\nWe keep the bonus simple, measurable, and tied directly to delivering elevated guest experiences.\n\r\n• Pool funding: $2.00 USD for every 5-star review received during the month.\n\r\n• Quality gate: Pool funded only if the monthly average rating is 4.85+ and the review rate is 80%+.\n\r\n• Distribution: The funded pool is divided equally among the Guest Experience Tea\nmbers.\n\r\n• Eligibility: You receive your share when monthly SLA and performance standards are met. Shares are not redistributed from non-eligible members.\n\r\n• Leadership role: As the Guest Experience Manager, you're responsible for supporting the team in achieving these monthly goals.\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation\n\r\nThese roles are fully remote within the Philippines. However, we are building our core Guest Experience team in Cebu City, and applicants located in Cebu City or nearby areas are strongly preferred.\n\r\nConcentrating our team locally helps us work more closely, support one another, and build the kind of connected, collaborative culture that lets us deliver truly elevated hospitality. It also allows for optional in-person training sessions, tea\netups, and shared learning opportunities.\n\r\nExceptional candidates from other regions will still be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole and Responsibilities:\n\r\nChampion the Elevated Promises (Quality & Standards)\n\r\n• Lead by example in delivering warm, proactive, responsive guest communication.\n\r\n• Review message threads and calls to ensure tone, clarity, accuracy, and elevated hospitality.\n\r\n• Coach the team to uphold Sierra Sol’s elevated standards in every interaction.\n\r\n• Support the team in meeting SLAs and monthly quality goals tied to our 5-Star Bonus Pool.\n\r\n• Demonstrate calm, empathetic communication during escalations and model elevated hospitality under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\nTeam Leadership & Coaching\n\r\n• Provide daily support and real-time guidance to Guest Experience Agents.\n\r\n• Run weekly 1:1s focused on tone, communication, efficiency, and problem-solving.\n\r\n• Provide shadowing, feedback, and continuous coaching.\n\r\n• Help build a positive, supportive team culture rooted in hospitality, care, and growth.\n\r\n• Oversee shift scheduling and ensure full coverage across peak periods (including weekends).\n\r\n\n\r\nGuest Experience & Operations\n\r\n• Monitor queues, ticket volume, and coverage to ensure fast and warm responses.\n\r\n• Solve escalated issues with confidence, empathy, and well-considered judgment.\n\r\n• Ensure smooth handoffs and detailed documentation for local field teams.\n\r\n• Own quality control across guest communication, workorder clarity, and task follow-through.\n\r\n• Support the team in delivering concierge-level stays across all markets.\n\r\n\n\r\nProperty Listing Management & OTA Updates\n\r\n• Oversee and quality-check all property listings in Guesty and across all OTAs (Airbnb, Vrbo, \n, etc.).\n\r\n• Ensure every listing is accurate, consistent, and reflects our elevated hospitality standards.\n\r\n• Lead seasonal updates: amenities, photos, descriptions, policies, access notes, and market-specific highlights.\n\r\n• Audit listings regularly for clarity, tone, accuracy, and brand alignment.\n\r\n• Work with Agents to correct gaps, improve listing quality, and add new information from inspections, field reports, or homeowner updates.\n\r\n• Partner with leadership to optimize listing content for search visibility, guest clarity, and better pre-arrival communication.\n\r\n• Ensure every property description enhances the guest journey, reduces friction, and helps set the expectation for a five-star stay.\n\r\n\n\r\nLocal Knowledge & Expertise\n\r\n• Own the knowledge base for all New Mexico homes and markets: Santa Fe, Taos, Angel Fire, and Red River.\n\r\n• Maintain deep understanding of seasonal rhythms, weather and road impacts, and guest expectations unique to each area.\n\r\n• Stay up to date on restaurants, local events, activities, and experiences to ensure the team can provide personalized, concierge-level recommendations.\n\r\n• Ensure the Guest Experience team knows home layouts, amenities, quirks, access instructions, and “good to know” details through Matterport walkthroughs and photo reviews.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools, Systems, and Processes\n\r\n• Become an expert in Guesty, Breezeway, RingCentral, and internal SOP systems.\n\r\n• Coach the team on efficient, accurate, consistent use of all tools.\n\r\n• Identify workflow gaps and propose improvements that strengthen the guest journey and team performance.\n\r\n• Provide weekly reporting on SLAs, trends, and opportunities\n\r\n• Identify recurring issues and implement practical improvements to reduce friction and improve reviews\n\r\n\n\r\nManager Success Measures\n\r\n• The guest journey feels warm, seamless, and elevated.\n\r\n• Message response times and phone SLAs are consistently met (messages within 15 minutes; calls within 30 seconds).\n\r\n• The team feels supported, confident, and connected.\n\r\n• Escalations are handled calmly and resolved with care.\n\r\n• Workorders and tasks are clear, complete, and closed-loop. No missed workorders.\n\r\n• Monthly average rating stays above 4.85+ with review rate above 80%+.\n\r\n• The team embodies Sierra Sol’s elevated hospitality every day.\n\r\n• A team culture that feels like hospitality, not a help desk.\n\r\n• Comfortable leading day-to-day operations inside Guesty, Breezeway, and RingCentral.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\nPlease submit the following:\n\r\n• Resume/CV\n\r\n• 3-minute voice recording introducing yourself and describing your leadership style and experience\n\r\n• Speedtest.net result (screenshot)\n\r\n• Short written samples: How would you respond or lead in the following situations?\n\r\n1) A guest arrives on a Saturday evening and messages: “The house is freezing and we can’t figure out the heater.

I'm launching Pi9 AI — a €997 course that teaches solo coaches, therapists, and consultants how to market themselves on LinkedIn without losing their soul.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT generic \"LinkedIn tips\" content.\n\r\nThis is psychology-informed, purpose-driven marketing for conscious professionals who HATE traditional marketing tactics.\n\r\nI'm looking for a Filipino ghostwriter who can help me launch this in the next 50 days.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Makes This Project Different:\n\r\n\n\r\nMost LinkedIn courses teach:\n\r\n\"Post 5x/day and go viral\"\n\r\n\"Use these AI prompts to hack the algorithm\"\n\r\n\"Scale to 7 figures fast\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe teach:\n\r\n\"The world NEEDS what you've been hiding\"\n\r\n\"Purpose is a GIFT—you have a RESPONSIBILITY to shine\"\n\r\n\"Marketing isn't vanity, it's STEWARDSHIP\"\n\r\nWe extract clients' \"Voice DNA\" (using Enneagram psychology) FIRST, then calibrate AI to write in their authentic voice.\n\r\n\n\r\nTagline: \"We tune the signal before we amplify it.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role:\n\r\nI need someone who can:\n\r\n\n\r\nUnderstand nuanced concepts: Enneagram psychology, Voice DNA, transformation work, purpose-driven messaging\n\r\nWrite in a \"challenger\" tone: Direct, respectful, no fluff (NOT motivational guru style)\n\r\nWork FAST without sacrificing quality: 50-day sprint = tight deadlines\n\r\nBe coachable: I give detailed feedback, you iterate quickly\n\r\nThink strategically: Not just execute—help me see what's working/not working\n\r\nYour Target Avatar: \"The Invisible Expert\"\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be writing for solo practitioners who:\n\r\nAre brilliant at their craft (coaches, hypnotherapists, consultants)\n\r\nCan transform lives in one session\n\r\nHATE marketing (it feels icky, like selling out)\n\r\nLinkedIn = either totally silent OR sounds robotic when they try\n\r\n\n\r\nTheir Pain (7-Layer Invisibility Crisis):\n\r\nTried ChatGPT ? sounded robotic ? gave up\n\r\nPosted manually ? no engagement (didn't speak to PAIN) ? gave up\n\r\nProfile looks like 2012 CV ? no trust\n\r\nPost 3x/week ? 12 views ? algorithm buried them\n\r\nFlannel shirt selfie ? looks like hobbyist, not $5K expert\n\r\nCompetitors crush it with video ? don't know where to start\n\r\nKnow organic is dead ? LinkedIn Ads feel overwhelming\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Emotional Pain:\n\r\n\"I'm squandering my purpose by staying invisible. Someone out there needs what I offer and can't find me.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Write:\n\r\nWeek 1-2 (Launch Prep):\n\r\n7 LinkedIn posts (spiritual hooks, pain agitation, solution focus)\n\r\nSales page copy sections (hero, problem, solution, CTA)\n\r\n5\n nurture sequence\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 3-7 (Launch Phase):\n\r\n3 LinkedIn posts per week\n\r\nAd copy for LinkedIn Ads\n\r\nDM scripts for warm outreach\n\r\nSocial media captions (if needed)\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 8+ (Post-Launch):\n\r\n2-3 LinkedIn posts per week\n\r\nStudent testimonial/case study writeups\n\r\nModule descriptions for course content\n\r\nOngoing\n campaigns\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tone (CRITICAL to Understand):\n\r\nNOT:\n\r\n? Motivational coach: \"You can do this! Believe in yourself!\"\n\r\n? Corporate jargon: \"Leverage synergies for optimal outcomes\"\n\r\n? Guru-on-throne: \"I have the secrets, follow me\"\n\r\n\n\r\nIS:\n\r\n? Challenger: Respectful but direct (\"Here's the truth...\")\n\r\n? Fellow practitioner: \"I've been there, here's what actually works\"\n\r\n? Intellectual rigor: No fluff, no hype, respect their intelligence\n\r\n\n\r\nExample Posts:\n\r\n? GOOD:\n\r\n\"You tried ChatGPT. It sounded robotic. So you gave up.\n\r\nHere's why: Garbage in, garbage out.\n\r\nYou handed AI a blank slate. No context about your voice. No data about your psychological patterns.\n\r\nPi9 AI is different. We extract your Voice DNA FIRST—using the Enneagram (your psychological blueprint).\n\r\nTHEN we teach AI to write like YOU.\n\r\nNot louder. Not robotic. Just authentically, unmistakably YOU.\n\r\nBridge the AI Marketing Gap: \n\"\n\r\n\n\r\n? BAD:\n\r\n\"Unlock your LinkedIn potential with AI! Transform your profile today and watch the magic happen! You CAN do this! ?????\"\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Language to Use:\n\r\n\n\r\nUSE THESE TERMS:\n\r\nVoice DNA / Voice Sovereignty\n\r\nGarbage in, garbage out\n\r\nWe tune the signal before we amplify it\n\r\nBridge the AI Marketing Gap\n\r\nFull-Stack LinkedIn Operating System\n\r\nPurpose is a gift / responsibility to shine\n\r\nMarketing = stewardship\n\r\nInvisible Expert\n\r\nMarketing paralysis\n\r\n\n\r\nNEVER USE:\n\r\n10X your followers\n\r\nGo viral\n\r\nScale to 7 figures\n\r\nHack the algorithm\n\r\n\"Game-changing\" / \"Revolutionary\"\n\r\nGeneric motivation phrases\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Spiritual Foundation:\n\r\nThis is what makes Pi9 AI different from every other LinkedIn course:\n\r\nThe world NEEDS what our clients have been hiding.\n\r\nPurpose is a GIFT. They're not allowed to squander it.\n\r\nThey have a RESPONSIBILITY to shine—not for ego, but because someone out there is searching for exactly what they offer.\n\r\nMarketing isn't vanity.

You know what a \"system prompt\" is.\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh Agency: You don’t wait for a manual. You Google it, YouTube it, or ask the AI until it works.\n\r\n\n\r\nCurious: You want to understand how a global hardware business operates.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer:\n\r\n\n\r\nFull Access: We pay for all the AI tools you need.\n\r\n\n\r\nTotal Freedom: If you find a better way to do things, we do it your way.\n\r\n\n\r\nDirect Impact: Your automations will be used in real global deals immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nMentorship: Work directly with the founders and learn the \"real world\" of international trade.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply: Don't send a CV. Send us a 2-minute video or write a text to something cool you have built, automated, or \"vibe-coded\" recently.                ",

A strong understanding of English and social media content is crucial here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be working hand in hand with me on an extremely viral social media page and there is room for bonuses if deadlines are met and the content performs well!\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\nAttention to detail\n\r\nSTRONG English\n\r\nStrong internet connection\n\r\nPrevious experience with Capcut / TikTok / Instagram\n\r\nGood working with a team\n\r\nAbility to learn and take constructive feedback\n\r\nAvailability to work 3-4h a day (with potential for more and increased salary)\n\r\nAble to work 5-6 days per week (can take days off whenever as long as mostly consistent)\n\r\nCan take payments through Wise\n\r\nPH or similar time zone\n\r\n\n\r\n$300/month + bonuses for 2-3h a day MAX and potential full time work in the future with a salary increase.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please complete the recreate assignment below so I can see your skills (1h max)\n\r\n\n\r\nBelow is a Google drive with the original files you will need to re-create this reference video:\n\r\n\n\r\nReference video: \n\r\n\n\r\nGoogle drive:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease complete the following steps:\n\r\n- Download the files and import into your video editing software\n\r\n- Find the “good” takes of the footage and stitch together seamlessly \n\r\n- Add overlays and additional effects to the edited footage\n\r\n- Pay close attention to detail in the selection of the clips, the pacing (duration of each scene), cropping, etc.\n\r\n- Message me with a link to the re-created video                ",

I can direct learning quite effectively, I think. Several of my friends run multimillion dollar companies, I have a good grasp of what's necessary here and I don't see any reason why someone motivated can't learn, given time and quality direction. You'll be learning about AI, how money works, marketing, sales, etc. You'll handle the majority of execution with my mentorship.\n\r\n\n\r\nSend me evidence of:\n\r\n- Learning quickly\n\r\n- Work ethic. Character. Honesty.\n\r\n- The ability to execute towards a goal by yourself, not only doing what you're told. Creativity.\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking for several people to do this as their main focus, I can bump the number of hours if needed. Note that I'm looking for people I can work with long-term. The real gains will start to show up after 3 months of intensive learning.\n\r\n\n\r\nI've kept the salary near the low end at $3/hr as a nudge towards people who value learning and believe in their own success.

Our brands, Plastair, DeeVa, and PlastairFyre, are built on differentiated products, strong margins, and when appropriate, utility patents or design patents. We manufacture in Canada, or source electronics overseas, then protect and position them properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have a strong presence in brick and mortar retail in North America for decades. Now we are building a serious digital revenue engine.

You will own digital revenue results across Amazon Seller, Shopify DTC, and additional marketplaces including Walmart, Wayfair, and digital B2B platforms such as Faire and Grainger.\n\r\n\n\r\n- This is not a VA role, not a coordinator role, not a task manager role.

rebuild our creative production function to improve speed, accuracy, and quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like:\n\r\n\n\r\nWithin 60 to 90 days, ownership should experience a real reduction in

to 4 people across ads execution and creative production\n\r\n\n\r\nB-uild SOPs so performance does not depend on any one person\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Already Have:\n\r\n\n\r\nS-trong product
