Maintain a simple weekly performance report (spend, purchases, ROAS/MER as applicable, CPA, top audiences/creatives, key learnings, next actions)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. What we are NOT looking for\n\r\ni. Awareness/discovery campaign focus\n\r\nii. “Growth hacker” generalist\n\r\niii.

Following a major Supreme Court\n\r\nruling that struck down billions in tariffs, we are building a team to identify and contact importers\n\r\nwho are owed refunds from the US government. This is a ground-floor opportunity with a fast-\n\r\ngrowing company.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do:\n\r\nThis is a pure research and data role. You will NOT speak to clients or make phone calls. All\n\r\nwork is written/digital.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Search public US customs databases (Port Examiner, ImportGenius, public bill of lading\n\r\nrecords) to identify US companies that import goods\n\r\n• Record company names, addresses, contact information, products imported, countries of\n\r\norigin, HTS (tariff) codes, and shipment volumes\n\r\n• Organize all data in clean, structured Google Sheets following our templates\n\r\n• Cross-reference company data with LinkedIn and company websites to find decision-maker\n\r\nnames and\n addresses\n\r\n• Flag high-value targets (companies importing from China, Canada, or Mexico with large\n\r\nshipment volumes)\n\r\n• Track and categorize importers by industry, port of entry, import volume, and country of origin\n\r\n• Daily goal: research and add\nqualified companies to the prospect database\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills:\n\r\n• Strong research skills — you enjoy digging through databases and finding information\n\r\n\n\r\n• Excellent attention to detail — data must be accurate (company names, HTS codes,\n\r\naddresses)\n\r\n• Comfortable with Google Sheets or Excel (sorting, filtering, basic formulas)\n\r\n• Basic English reading comprehension (you will be reading US business websites and import\n\r\nrecords)\n\r\n• Reliable internet connection and own laptop/computer\n\r\n• Available to start within 48 hours\n\r\n• Able to work independently and follow detailed SOPs\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to Have (Not Required):\n\r\n• Experience with lead generation, B2B prospecting, or skip tracing\n\r\n• Familiarity with LinkedIn Sales Navigator, \n, \n, or ZoomInfo\n\r\n• Previous experience researching US companies or import/export data\n\r\n• Any knowledge of HTS codes, customs, or international trade (we will train you if not)\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule:\n\r\nFull-time (40 hours/week). Flexible hours — you can work PH daytime if preferred. What\n\r\nmatters is output, not when you sit at the desk. Daily targets will be set and reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation:\n\r\n$400-$500 USD/month starting, based on experience. Performance bonuses for exceeding\n\r\ndaily research targets. This company is growing fast — top performers will be promoted to team\n\r\nlead roles within 60-90 days as we hire additional researchers.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nSend a message with:\n\r\n1. A brief description of any research, data entry, or lead generation work you have done before\n\r\n2. How many hours per day you can start working this week\n\r\n3. Your experience with Google Sheets (basic, intermediate, or advanced)\n\r\n4. Write the word \"IMPORT\" at the top of your application so I know you read this entire posting\n\r\n\n\r\n??

    "description": "\n                    AccrediPro University is an internationally accredited online certification platform with 5K+ enrolled students. We train health coaches, wellness coaches, and other health professionals through certification courses.\n\r\nOur courses include interactive case study simulations.\n\r\n\n\r\nAttention: This will be NOT  a One-Time gig if it goes well. We have 100+ courses. \n\r\nRate to be agreed based on volume\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's how they work:\n\r\n? A real, credentialed health professional (the coach) appears on video explaining clinical concepts\n\r\n? An actress (YOU) plays the role of a simulated patient, presenting symptoms on camera following a script\n\r\n? The student watches your video, then selects a response\n\r\n? Based on the student's choice, a different video plays: correct answer ? Video A, wrong answer 1 ? Video B, wrong answer 2 ? Video C, etc.\n\r\n? Each case study has multiple branching videos that need to be recorded\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: You will be openly presented as an actress. Students know from the start that the patient is played by an actress — there is a welcome video where you introduce yourself and your character. The clinical/educational content is always delivered by real licensed professionals. Your role is purely performative.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU DO:\n\r\n? Follow a simple, provided script where you describe symptoms, emotions, and situations (e.g. \"I've been feeling anxious for weeks\", \"My hormones feel out of balance\", \"I lost someone close to me and I can't cope\")\n\r\n? Record multiple video variations per case study (one per branching path)\n\r\n? Be willing to adapt your look per role: different characters may require different styling, wigs, makeup, wardrobe — you need to be open and flexible about transforming your appearance based on the patient you are playing\n\r\n? Deliver believable, natural performances — not theatrical, not robotic. You are a patient talking to a coach. It needs to feel real.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE PROVIDE:\n\r\n? Full script with all lines and emotional directions\n\r\n? Character brief (who you are, what symptoms you present, your emotional state)\n\r\n? Technical specs for recording\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS — NON-NEGOTIABLE:\n\r\n? Female only\n\r\n? Fluent English — neutral or American accent is a MUST. No heavy regional accent. This is non-negotiable for course quality and audience perception.\n\r\n? Natural and convincing on camera — you must be able to portray emotions credibly (sadness, frustration, confusion, hope, relief, fear, etc.)\n\r\n? Willingness to change appearance per role: different makeup, wigs, wardrobe as needed to play different patient characters convincingly\n\r\n? Professional setup: good lighting, clean background, decent camera/webcam, clear audio\n\r\n? Ability to follow a script while sounding natural — not reading\n\r\n? Must provide valid government-issued ID before receiving any script or material\n\r\n\n\r\nPLUS:\n\r\n? Western-passing, international, or mestiza look — our audience is primarily Western (US, UK, EU). We need patient characters to feel relatable. Filipina-American, mixed heritage, or cosmopolitan look with good styling is a strong advantage.\n\r\n? Acting experience or training (theater, film, commercials, YouTube, content creation)\n\r\n? Own wardrobe variety and basic makeup/styling skills for character transformation\n\r\n? Own equipment: ring light, good webcam or camera, external microphone\n\r\n\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT:\n\r\n? Not a voiceover job — you are on camera, face visible at all times\n\r\n? Not a one-time gig IF IT GOES WELL  — we have 100+ courses, each with multiple case study scenarios and multiple patient characters. If you deliver quality, this becomes ongoing, consistent, well-paid work.\n\r\n? Not optional quality — poorly acted, poorly lit, or unconvincing videos will not be accepted or paid for\n\r\n\n\r\nVOLUME & OPPORTUNITY:\n\r\nWe are building an entire interactive case study library across 100+ courses. Each course may have multiple scenarios with different patient characters requiring different looks. This means recurring work, variety, and the chance to play many different roles over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & CONFIDENTIALITY:\n\r\nAll video material is proprietary to AccrediPro\n\r\n? You may NOT share, upload, distribute, or publish any recordings, scripts, or material online or offline\n\r\n? You may mention on your profile/CV that you worked with AccrediPro University , but you cannot show or share the actual content\n\r\n? All scripts and raw files must be deleted from your systems after final delivery unless agreed otherwise\n\r\n? A confidentiality agreement will be required before any material is shared\n\r\n\n\r\nWe work with international legal teams with direct operational capability in the Philippines. Any breach of confidentiality or unauthorized use of proprietary material will result in immediate legal action. Brand and image damages are pursued aggressively. This is not a warning — it is standard practice.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY:\n\r\nSend a message with:\n\r\n1) A short self-tape (30-60 seconds): introduce yourself in English, then act out a brief emotional scene of your choice (e.g. describe a health concern as if you were a patient speaking to a doctor). This is the single most important part of your application.\n\r\n2) Your experience (acting, video spokesperson, content creation, or similar)\n\r\n3) Your equipment setup (camera, lighting, microphone)\n\r\n4) Your availability and rate expectations\n\r\n\n\r\nNo self-tape = no consideration. We need to see and hear you before anything else.\n\r\nSerious applicants only.                ",

You will be the first employee of a company that is being built to become a global leader in relational governance for ultra-high-net-worth families, family offices, and multi-generational enterprises.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for one exceptional person. Not someone who follows instructions. Someone who thinks, anticipates, creates, and builds alongside us. If you see yourself as an entrepreneur who happens to work inside someone else's company — read on.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\n\n\r\nNomos is a specialist advisory firm based in Barcelona, with reach across Geneva, London, and Athens. We work with prominent families and family offices to restore trust, build governance structures, and protect wealth across generations. Our founder, Dimitra Doumpioti, brings decades of experience in family systems, governance, and relational intelligence. Our advisory board includes senior professionals from McKinsey, IESE, and the global family enterprise world.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe company is led by Ed Davidson, a British entrepreneur who has built businesses from zero to over £80 million in revenue. Ed has a long history of working with Filipino teams — many of whom started as early employees and went on to buy homes, cars, and transform their lives through the growth of those companies. He is looking to do exactly the same here.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a ground-floor opportunity. The right person will grow with the company and be rewarded accordingly — not just with salary increases and bonuses, but with genuine equity participation if targets are met and trust is earned.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is broad by design. You will wear many hats, and that is the point. Your responsibilities will include:\n\r\n\n\r\nExecutive Support & Operations\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nManage calendars, correspondence, travel arrangements, and meeting preparation for both the Founder and Strategic Advisor\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nDraft and send professional\ns, proposals, and follow-up communications on behalf of the leadership team\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nMaintain CRM records, contact databases, and project tracking systems\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nResearch and prepare briefing documents ahead of client meetings and speaking engagements\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Media & Content\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSet up, manage, and grow all Nomos social media accounts (LinkedIn, Instagram, X/Twitter, and others as appropriate)\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSet up and manage personal LinkedIn profiles and content strategy for Dimitra Doumpioti\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWrite, schedule, and publish blog posts, thought leadership articles, and newsletter content\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCreate and curate content that positions Nomos as a global authority in relational governance\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nUnderstand and use AI tools (ChatGPT, Manus, Canva AI, scheduling tools, etc.) to maximise output and quality\n\r\n\n\r\nPR, Marketing & Business Development\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nResearch and secure speaking opportunities for Dimitra at global conferences, summits, and industry events (family office, HNWI, governance, wealth management sectors)\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIdentify and pitch to relevant publications — family office magazines, HNWI lifestyle publications, governance journals, business media\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nBuild and maintain a media contact list and manage ongoing PR relationships\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nResearch potential clients, partners, and collaboration opportunities\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSupport the preparation of pitch decks, marketing materials, and client-facing documents\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth & Strategy Support\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nTrack industry trends, competitor activity, and market opportunities in the family governance space\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nContribute ideas and initiatives — we want someone who brings solutions, not just questions\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nHelp systematise and document internal processes as the company scales\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n\n\r\nNon-negotiable requirements:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou speak, read, write, and think in fluent, professional English. Not \"good\" English — excellent English. Your written communication must be indistinguishable from a native speaker. We will test this rigorously.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou have at least 3 years of experience in a similar role — executive assistant, marketing coordinator, social media manager, or operations role — ideally supporting a founder or senior executive.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou are proficient with modern tools: Google Workspace, social media platforms, Canva or similar design tools, AI assistants, CRM systems, and project management tools.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou are based in the Philippines and available to work full-time during hours that overlap with European business hours (CET/CEST).\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat will set you apart:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAn entrepreneurial mindset. You do not wait to be told what to do. You see what needs doing and you do it.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nGenuine curiosity about business, strategy, and how companies grow. You read, you learn, you stay sharp.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nExperience with LinkedIn content strategy, blog writing, or PR outreach.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nFamiliarity with the world of family offices, wealth management, or professional services (not required, but a strong advantage).\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nA track record of taking ownership — not just completing tasks, but improving how things are done.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nComfort working with AI tools and a willingness to learn new ones quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nDiscretion and professionalism.

If you perform, you will be promoted, compensated, and given real ownership. Ed has done this before — multiple times — and the results speak for themselves.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Interview Process\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are serious about finding the right person. The process will be thorough:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n\r\nApplication Review — We will read every application carefully. Generic copy-paste applications will be discarded immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\n2.\n\r\nWritten Questionnaire — Shortlisted candidates will receive a detailed written assessment. This will test your English, your thinking, your initiative, and your ability to research and present information clearly.\n\r\n\n\r\n3.\n\r\nVideo Interview — Candidates who pass the written stage will be interviewed via video call.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.\n\r\nFace-to-Face Interview — Ed will fly to Manila in late March / early April 2026 to conduct final interviews in person with the top candidates.\n\r\n\n\r\n5.\n\r\nFinal Selection & Offer — One candidate will be selected and offered the position.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe expect a high volume of applications. We will be rigorous but fair. If you are the right person, you will know it — and so will we.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application with:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n\r\nYour CV/resume (PDF format preferred)\n\r\n\n\r\n2.\n\r\nA cover letter (maximum one page) explaining why you are the right person for this specific role.

    "description": "\n                    First Employee | Ground Floor Opportunity | ECD Creative\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout This Opportunity\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not just another job posting. This is an invitation to become the first employee of a luxury interior design firm that is being rebuilt from the ground up—and if you are the right person, this could be the most significant career decision you ever make.\n\r\n\n\r\nI am Ed Davidson, founder of ECD Creative. Over the past thirty years, I have built multiple businesses from zero to over £80 million in revenue. Along that journey, I employed many talented Filipino professionals who worked with me for years, earned well, bought houses and cars, and genuinely transformed their lives and the lives of their families. I am looking to do the same again—but this time, I am looking for one exceptional person to join me at the very beginning.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe business we are building serves ultra-high-net-worth clients worldwide. Our client list has included royal families in Thailand, Bahrain, and Kuwait; Madonna; Guy Ritchie; Fortnum & Mason; and The Peninsula Hotels. We create bespoke residential and commercial interiors that become cultural legacies, not just decorated rooms. The work is world-class, the clients are extraordinary, and the potential is enormous.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut right now, we are at the beginning. I need someone who understands what that means—someone who sees opportunity where others see risk, someone who is willing to work harder than they have ever worked before because they know the payoff will be worth it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Exists\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the first three to six months, your primary focus will be reputation management and digital presence. This is strategic, high-impact work that will directly determine whether we win or lose major projects worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe luxury interior design industry is built on reputation, credibility, and visibility. Potential clients research designers extensively before making contact. They look at social media, read articles, check Google results, and assess whether a designer has the gravitas and expertise to be trusted with multi-million-pound projects.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to ensure that when someone searches for ECD Creative or Ed Davidson, they find a consistent, compelling, and credible digital presence that positions us as the world-class firm we are. This is not about \"likes\" or \"engagement metrics\" for the sake of vanity—this is about building the digital infrastructure that converts high-value leads into paying clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter the first three to six months, your role will expand into broader marketing, client relationship management, project coordination, and potentially business development. If you prove yourself exceptional, there will be opportunities for salary increases, bonuses, and eventually equity in the business.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do (First 3-6 Months)\n\r\n\n\r\nYour initial focus will be reputation management and digital presence. Specifically, you will:\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Media Management:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCreate and schedule high-quality social media posts for LinkedIn and Instagram that showcase our design work, expertise, and industry knowledge\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWrite compelling captions that reflect our brand voice (sophisticated, knowledgeable, confident but not arrogant)\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nResearch and curate relevant content (design trends, luxury lifestyle, architecture, antiques) to position us as thought leaders\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nEngage with relevant accounts, industry influencers, and potential clients in a strategic and professional manner\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Creation:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWrite blog posts for the \"Insights\" section of our website on topics such as luxury interior design trends, antique sourcing, working with UHNW clients, and design philosophy\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nDraft case studies for portfolio projects that tell compelling stories about the work we have done\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCreate content that is optimised for search engines (SEO) while remaining elegant and readable\n\r\n\n\r\nMedia Outreach:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nResearch and compile lists of podcasts, publications, journalists, and industry influencers who cover luxury interior design, architecture, and lifestyle\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nDraft initial outreach\ns for me to review and send (you will not be sending cold\ns yourself, but you will be preparing them for my approval)\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIdentify opportunities for guest articles, interviews, podcast appearances, and media features\n\r\n\n\r\nReputation Monitoring:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSet up and monitor Google Alerts for mentions of my name and the business\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nTrack online sentiment and flag any issues that require attention\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIdentify opportunities to respond to press mentions, industry discussions, or client testimonials\n\r\n\n\r\nBacklink Building:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIdentify legitimate opportunities to build backlinks to our website through guest posts, industry directories, design awards, and editorial features\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nConduct outreach to relevant websites and publications to secure backlinks that improve our search engine rankings\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-Assisted Workflow:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nUse AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper, etc.) to accelerate content creation, research, and drafting—but you must be able to edit, refine, and elevate AI-generated content to a professional standard\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nUnderstand how to prompt AI effectively to get high-quality outputs that match our brand voice\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Happens After the First 3-6 Months\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you excel in the initial phase, your role will expand significantly. You will take on broader responsibilities, including:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nManaging client communications and project coordination\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAssisting with business development and lead generation\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nOverseeing marketing campaigns and advertising spend\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCoordinating with contractors, suppliers, and partners\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nPotentially managing additional tea\nmbers as we grow\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a static role. If you are ambitious, capable, and driven, you will grow with the business—and your compensation will grow accordingly.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for someone who is exceptional. Not good. Not \"pretty good.\" Exceptional.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is what that means:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou speak, read, and write perfect English.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYour written English must be flawless. No grammatical errors, no awkward phrasing, no \"close enough\" approximations. You must be able to write professional\ns, blog posts, and social media captions that sound like they were written by a native English speaker with a university education.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYour spoken English must be clear, confident, and articulate. You will be communicating with me daily via Zoom, Slack, or WhatsApp, and I need to be able to understand you perfectly without asking you to repeat yourself.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are motivated by opportunity, not just salary.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nThe starting salary is 40,000 PHP per month for the first six months. After six months, we will review your performance and increase your salary accordingly. If you hit targets and exceed expectations, there will be bonuses. If you prove yourself indispensable, there will be equity.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nI am not looking for someone who sees this as \"just a job.\" I am looking for someone who understands that being the first employee of a business that could become worth millions is an opportunity that most people never get.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have an entrepreneurial attitude and work ethic.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou do not need to be told what to do every day. You take initiative, solve problems, and find ways to add value without being micromanaged.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou are comfortable with ambiguity. We are building something from scratch, which means there will be days when priorities shift, plans change, and you need to adapt quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou are willing to work hard. This is not a 9-to-5 role. There will be weeks when you need to work evenings or weekends to meet deadlines. If you are looking for a comfortable, low-stress job, this is not it.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are experienced in digital marketing, social media, and content creation.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou have at least 2-3 years of experience managing social media accounts, creating content, and running digital marketing campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou understand SEO, backlink building, and how to improve search engine rankings.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou know how to use AI tools to accelerate your work, but you also know how to edit and refine AI-generated content to a professional standard.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou are familiar with tools like Canva, Hootsuite, Buffer, Google Analytics, and WordPress.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are detail-oriented and quality-obsessed.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou do not send work that has typos, formatting errors, or sloppy mistakes. You proofread everything twice before submitting it.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou understand that in the luxury industry, quality matters more than quantity. One excellent blog post is worth ten mediocre ones.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are honest, reliable, and professional.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou show up on time for meetings. You meet deadlines. You communicate clearly when there are problems.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou do not make excuses. If you make a mistake, you own it, fix it, and learn from it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Selection Process (This Will Be Rigorous)\n\r\n\n\r\nI am not hiring the first person who applies. I am hiring the best person, even if it takes months to find them.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere is how the process will work:\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1: Initial Application\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou will submit your CV, a cover letter, and answers to a detailed questionnaire (see below).\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nI will review every application personally. If your English is not perfect, if your answers are generic, or if you clearly have not read this job posting carefully, you will not move forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2: Written Assessment\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIf you pass the initial screening, you will be asked to complete a written assessment. This will involve writing a blog post, drafting social media captions, and creating a content strategy for a hypothetical project.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nThis will take 2-3 hours of your time. It is unpaid. If you are not willing to invest that time to prove your abilities, this role is not for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 3: Video Interview\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIf your written assessment is excellent, we will schedule a video interview via Zoom. I will ask you about your experience, your approach to work, and your long-term goals.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nI will also assess your spoken English, your professionalism, and whether you are someone I can trust to represent my business.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 4: Face-to-Face Interview in Manila\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nI will be flying to Manila in late March or early April 2025 to conduct final interviews in person.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIf you make it to this stage, we will meet face-to-face, discuss the role in detail, and determine whether we are a good fit for each other.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 5: Job Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIf you are selected, you will receive a formal job offer with a clear contract, salary structure, and performance expectations.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation and Benefits\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting Salary: ?40,000 PHP for the first six months.\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter Six Months: Salary review based on performance. If you are meeting or exceeding expectations, your salary will increase significantly.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonuses: Performance-based bonuses for hitting key targets (e.g., securing media features, driving website traffic, generating client leads).\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term Potential: If you prove yourself exceptional over the first 12-24 months, there will be opportunities for equity in the business. This means you could own a percentage of a company that could be worth millions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Environment: Fully remote. You can work from home, a co-working space, or anywhere with a reliable internet connection.\n\r\n\n\r\nWorking Hours: Flexible, but you must be available for regular check-ins via Zoom or Slack during UK business hours (GMT/BST). Some evening or weekend work may be required during busy periods.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have read this entire job posting and you believe you are the right person for this role, here is what you need to do:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Submit your CV (in English, PDF format, no longer than 2 pages).\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Write a cover letter (\nwords) that answers the following questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWhy are you interested in this role?\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWhat makes you the best candidate for this position?\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWhat is the biggest professional achievement you are most proud of, and why?\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Answer the following questionnaire:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Questionnaire\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease answer the following questions in detail. Your answers should be thoughtful, specific, and demonstrate your understanding of the role.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. English Proficiency Test\n\r\nWrite a 150-word social media caption for LinkedIn that introduces ECD Creative to a luxury interior design audience. The caption should be sophisticated, engaging, and include a call-to-action. (Imagine this is the first post on our new LinkedIn page.)\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Content Strategy Question\n\r\nYou have been asked to write a blog post titled \"The Art of Sourcing Antiques for Luxury Interiors.\" Outline the structure of the blog post (introduction, key sections, conclusion) and explain what research you would do before writing it.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Reputation Management Scenario\n\r\nYou discover that when someone searches for \"Ed Davidson\" on Google, the first page of results includes an old negative article from 2018 about a business dispute. What steps would you take to push this article down in the search results and replace it with positive content?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AI and Workflow Efficiency\n\r\nDescribe how you would use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to accelerate your work in this role. Give a specific example of a task you would use AI for, and explain how you would ensure the output is high-quality and on-brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Motivation and Long-Term Goals\n\r\nWhy are you willing to work for £500 per month when you could probably find a higher-paying job elsewhere? What do you see as the long-term opportunity in this role, and how do you plan to make yourself indispensable?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Work Ethic and Problem-Solving\n\r\nDescribe a time when you had to work under pressure to meet a tight deadline. What was the situation, what did you do, and what was the outcome?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. Availability and Commitment\n\r\nConfirm that you are available to start work immediately (or provide your notice period). Confirm that you are available for a face-to-face interview in Manila in late March or early April 2025.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this carefully.\n\r\n\n\r\nI am not looking for someone who is \"looking for a job.\" I am looking for someone who is looking for an opportunity to build something extraordinary.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are that person, I look forward to hearing from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nEd Davidson\n\r\nFounder, ECD Creative                ",

    "description": "\n                    OB DESCRIPTION\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\n\n\r\nSource Me It is a new London-based luxury sourcing company that connects high-net-worth clients, interior designers, and collectors worldwide with rare and extraordinary antiques, art, furniture, and decorative objects. We source from hidden markets, private collections, and trusted dealers across Europe and beyond — items that cannot be found online.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur founder, Ed, has over 30 years of experience in the luxury, creative, and antiques industries. He started his career at Christie's auction house at the age of 16, went on to work with some of the world's most recognised brands, hotels, and private clients across five continents, and previously built a company from zero to over £80 million in annual turnover — a company where many of the Filipino tea\nmbers were able to buy their own homes, cars, and genuinely transform their lives through hard work and shared success.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat company was in a different industry, but the principles are the same: find exceptional people, treat them well, give them real responsibility, and grow together. Source Me It is the next chapter, and we are looking for our first employee — someone who wants to be there from day one and grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe also have a sister company, ECD Creative, a luxury interior design and creative consultancy based in New York and London. The right candidate may also support this brand as we grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Is Special\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a typical VA position. You will not be doing data entry or answering phones. You are being hired as the first tea\nmber of a company that has genuine potential to become a significant global brand. The founder has done it before and knows exactly what it takes.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat that means for you:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou will have real responsibility from day one. Not busywork — meaningful work that directly impacts the company's growth.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYou will learn how to build a luxury brand from scratch. The founder will mentor you directly.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nYour growth is tied to the company's growth. After the initial 6-month period, performance bonuses will be introduced. For the right person who proves themselves exceptional, there is genuine potential for equity participation in the business — meaning you could own a piece of what we build together.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nThe founder has a track record of enriching the lives of Filipino tea\nmbers. This is not a promise made lightly. In his previous company, Filipino staff members who started at entry level went on to buy homes and cars. The same opportunity exists here for someone with the right attitude.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nDigital Marketing & Content Creation (Primary Focus — First 3 Months)\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nResearch, write, and publish blog posts and articles for the Source Me It website (and later ECD Creative) — topics include antiques, interior design, luxury markets, collecting, and European culture\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCreate, schedule, and manage all social media content across Instagram, LinkedIn,\n, Pinterest, and TikTok\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nBuild and grow our LinkedIn presence — connect with interior designers, architects, collectors, and luxury professionals worldwide\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWrite and send\n newsletters to our growing subscriber list\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCreate engaging captions, hashtags, and visual content strategies tailored to a luxury audience\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nMonitor social media engagement and respond to comments and messages professionally\n\r\n\n\r\nOnline Reputation & Brand Building\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nResearch and implement SEO strategies to improve our search engine rankings\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nWrite and publish thought-leadership content that positions the company as an authority\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nIdentify and pitch guest blog opportunities, press features, and PR placements\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nMonitor online mentions and manage the company's digital reputation\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSet up and manage Google Alerts and social listening tools\n\r\n\n\r\nAI & Technology\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nUse AI tools (ChatGPT, Manus, Canva AI, etc.) to accelerate content creation, research, and workflow\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nStay current with new AI tools and suggest ways to improve our efficiency\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nHelp manage and update our website content\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAssist with CRM and client database management\n\r\n\n\r\nOperations Support (As We Grow)\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nHelp coordinate sourcing requests between clients and suppliers\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAssist with preparing client proposals and presentations\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSupport with research on specific antiques, artists, periods, and markets\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nHelp manage supplier relationships and communications\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED SKILLS (Hard Skills)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have demonstrable experience in:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nExcellent written English — native-level grammar, spelling, and ability to write in a sophisticated, professional tone suitable for a luxury brand. This is non-negotiable. You will be writing content that high-net-worth clients and top interior designers will read.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSocial media management — proven experience managing business accounts on Instagram, LinkedIn,\n, and Pinterest. You should understand algorithms, engagement strategies, and content calendars.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nContent writing / blogging — ability to research topics and write long-form articles (1,000–2,000 words) that are informative, engaging, and SEO-optimised.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nBasic graphic design — comfortable using Canva or similar tools to create social media graphics, presentations, and simple marketing materials.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSEO fundamentals — understanding of on-page SEO, keyword research, meta descriptions, and how to write content that ranks.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nAI proficiency — experience using AI tools for content creation, research, or workflow automation. You should be comfortable learning new tools quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\n marketing — experience with\n platforms (Mailchimp, Resend, or similar) to create and send professional newsletters.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIRED QUALITIES (Soft Skills)\n\r\n\n\r\nEqually important to your technical skills:\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nEntrepreneurial mindset — you think like a business owner, not an employee. You see problems and fix them without being asked. You care about the company's success as if it were your own.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nSelf-motivated and proactive — you do not need to be micromanaged. You take initiative, manage your own time, and deliver without constant supervision.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nExceptional attention to detail — in a luxury brand, every word, every image, every interaction matters. Sloppy work is not acceptable.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nHunger to learn and grow — you are not looking for a comfortable job. You are looking for an opportunity to develop yourself, learn new skills, and build something meaningful.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nReliability and honesty — you show up, you deliver what you promise, and you communicate openly when there are problems. Trust is everything in a small team.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nThick skin and resilience — startup life is not always smooth. There will be pressure, tight deadlines, and \nnts of uncertainty. You need to be someone who thrives under pressure, not crumbles.\n\r\n\n\r\n•\n\r\nCultural sensitivity — our clients are wealthy, discerning individuals from the USA, Middle East, Asia, and Europe. You must be comfortable communicating in a way that reflects the sophistication of our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\nBenefit\n\r\nDetails\n\r\nSalary\n\r\n£1,000 GBP/month (~?73,000) for the first 6 months\n\r\nPerformance Bonuses\n\r\nIntroduced after 6 months based on KPIs and company performance\n\r\nEquity Potential\n\r\nFor exceptional performers, genuine opportunity to earn equity in the company\n\r\nDirect Mentorship\n\r\nWork directly with the founder — learn luxury brand building from someone who has built an £80M+ company\n\r\nCareer Growth\n\r\nAs the first employee, you will grow into a senior role as the company scales\n\r\nWork Schedule\n\r\nFlexible within reason — we need overlap with UK business hours (some flexibility for PH timezone)\n\r\nEquipment\n\r\nYou must have your own reliable computer and stable internet connection\n\r\n13th Month\n\r\nYes, we will honour the 13th month payment\n\r\nPaid Leave\n\r\nStandard PH holidays plus additional leave after 6 months\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE INTERVIEW PROCESS\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are being very selective because this hire is critical. The process will be:\n\r\n\n\r\nStage 1: Application\n\r\nApply with your CV/resume and a cover letter explaining why you are the right person for this role.
