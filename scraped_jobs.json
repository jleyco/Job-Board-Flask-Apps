And do you have experience helping online creators with courses and funnels?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n (BHWA) is a well-established aging health and caregiving education website created by me, Dr. Leslie Kernisan, MD. I’m a geriatrician and blogger growing an online membership for people helping aging parents. I also have two YouTube channels and a podcast.\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m now hiring for a smart and very detail-oriented executive virtual assistant who will be helping me execute, document, coordinate, and problem-solve in all areas of my business.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe role will start at about 20 hours per week, with potential to grow in hours (and in hourly rate!), if you are able to do the job well and take more off my plate. When you get the work done is flexible, but you’ll need to do at least a few hours every weekday.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease note that I have been running BHWA for 10+ years, I’ve had the same Ph-based VA doing routine tasks and customer service since 2020, and I do have ongoing freelancers to help with things like video editing and complex automations. Although I am always learning and growing, at this point I know my business very well, and I know what works well for me when it comes to VAs.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is NOT for someone who just wants to be handed tasks to do. For this executive VA role, I need to find someone very much like me: smart, organized, proactive, and EXTREMELY detail-oriented. Someone who will double-check that things are done correctly (e.g. the links in an\n broadcast), so that I don’t have to. Someone who can figure out why something isn’t working and fix it, so that I don’t have to.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will also need to be willing and able to document everything you do as you go along; I have found this is critical to running the business long-term. (So if you are the type who likes to go fixing problems but skips documenting what you changed and why, you are not a good fit.)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must have previous experience with Clickup and Wordpress. Experience with ActiveCampaign, Kajabi, and YouTube is strongly preferred.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will need to be excellent at following instructions and also resourceful enough to figure things out and solve problems when necessary. During your training phase, you will need to be checking with me often; once we have gotten to know each other and you’ve demonstrated that you can do the work according to my standards, I will be happy to give you more autonomy.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis will be a great steady job for the right person! If you think you are a good fit, please apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nJOB TITLE\n\r\nVirtual Executive Assistant\n\r\nExecutive Assistant & Operations Assistant\n\r\n\n\r\nJOB DETAILS\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n- $8-10/hour (negotiable depending on skills and experience), with the possibility of raising the rate once you have learned the business and are freeing up my time\n\r\n- Paid every two weeks (or monthly) via Wise\n\r\n\n\r\nWork hours:\n\r\n- 3-4 hours every week day, up to 20 hours/week as a start. More may be occasionally needed. Weekly hours can be increased if you are able to take on additional responsibilities.\n\r\n- My working hours are usually between 9am to 4pm Pacific Time. You do not need to do all your work within this window, but should be available for meetings if requested.\n\r\n- The company tracks work hours using Hubstaff\n\r\n\n\r\nKnowledge and experience requirement:\n\r\n- Experience in task and project coordination using ClickUp\n\r\n- Experience with online optin forms, basic automations and funnels\n\r\n- At least one year experience of working-from-home as a virtual assistant, preferably as Executive Assistant\n\r\n- Excellent problem-solving skills, resilient and determined to find or create solutions.\n\r\n- A proven work ethic and the ability to anticipate needs, initiate decisions and coordinate the activities of others.\n\r\n- Experience with data reporting and Excel spreadsheets\n\r\n- Experience working with our current tech stack is strongly preferred: for BHWA these include Wordpress, ActiveCampaign, Kajabi, OptinMonster, Google analytics, Zapier, YouTube.\n\r\n\n\r\nScope of support:\n\r\nAdministrative and operations support to Dr. Leslie Kernisan, founder and principal of Better Health While Aging. Duties may include (but are not limited to):\n\r\n- Attend, participate and take notes for weekly planning meetings\n\r\n- Assist Dr. K with documentation of her work and with execution of her various tasks\n\r\n- Project coordination using Clickup; monitor and communicate project status, ensure that it’s updated and next steps are clear for everyone\n\r\n- Compile and present status reports\n\r\n- Monitoring and reporting on key performance indicators\n\r\n- Contribute to improving our process for handling member registrations, cancellations, and other customer support issues\n\r\n- Assisting with the creation and organization of registration pages and other logistics, when we run our membership enrollment drives\n\r\n- Assisting with the Company’s website and related\n subscriber list\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nTo apply, you must do the following things:\n\r\n- Make sure your profile in Onlinejobs.ph includes IQ and DISC assessment\n\r\n- Include the words AGING IS IMPORTANT in the subject line of your message to me\n\r\n- Send me a cover letter explaining why this position appeals to you and why you think you are an excellent fit\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly candidates who complete all the above will receive responses.

    "description": "\n                    We're looking for a sharp, reliable Virtual Personal Assistant to help a busy entrepreneur stay fully organized across personal life - health and fitness tracking, travel planning, reservations, errands, research, and daily logistics. You need to be fast, responsive, and always a step ahead. Strong research skills, attention to detail, and high integrity are non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a gig - it's a long-term partnership. I invest in people who invest in me. That means competitive pay now, raises over time, and real stability. The right person will never have to worry about finding another job. You have my back, I have yours.\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nWHAT DAY TO DAY LOOKS LIKE\n\r\n\n\r\n- I send you a photo of my lunch — you estimate macros and log it in my tracking sheet within minutes\n\r\n- I screenshot my body composition scan — you log every measurement and flag any trends\n\r\n- I tell you \"plan a weekend trip to Tulum for me and my girlfriend\" — you come back with flights, hotel, restaurant reservations, and a full itinerary without asking me 20 questions\n\r\n- Track all my subscriptions and flag me before anything renews so I can cancel what I don't need\n\r\n- Find me the best cold plunge under $5,000 — compare features, dimensions, cooling systems, warranties, and give me a top 3 with pros and cons\n\r\n- I want to start a new supplement stack for sleep optimization — research the science, find the best brands, figure out timing and dosages, and put it all in a clean doc I can follow\n\r\n- I mention I have a headache and haven't been sleeping well — you cross-reference my recent meals and macros to flag if something's off nutritionally before I even ask\n\r\n- I'm comparing two different health protocols I saw online — break down the science behind both, pros and cons, and tell me which one actually makes sense for my goals\n\r\n- I got bloodwork back — organize the results in a spreadsheet, flag anything out of range, and research what supplements or dietary changes could help\n\r\n- I'm training for a specific physical goal — research the best approach, recovery protocols, and adjust my nutrition tracking to match\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are plenty more tasks but hopefully that gives you a real picture of what this role looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nWHAT I'M LOOKING FOR\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven experience as a personal assistant — this is not an entry-level role\n\r\n- Fast communicator — responsive throughout 9am-9pm EST, 7 days a week\n\r\n- Proactive and independent — you figure things out and anticipate needs before being asked\n\r\n- Strong researcher — you dig deep, not just surface-level Googling\n\r\n- Organized and detail-oriented — nothing falls through the cracks\n\r\n- Comfortable using AI tools like Claude for research and efficiency (very important) - means your good at prompting\n\r\n- Interest in health and fitness — you'll be working with nutrition and body composition data daily\n\r\n- Honest and direct — if you make a mistake, tell me immediately. I'm understanding, I just need to know\n\r\n- Takes feedback well and always looking to improve\n\r\n- Trustworthy and discreet\n\r\n\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nWHY YOU'D WANT THIS ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-term stability — I don't cycle through assistants. I'm looking for someone to grow with for years, not months\n\r\nI'm a kind, direct, and reasonable person to work for. I don't micromanage. I give you goals and trust you to figure out the how \n\r\n\n\r\nCompetitive pay with consistent raises as we build together — your growth is tied to mine\n\r\n\n\r\nVariety every single day — no two days look the same. You'll never be bored\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be genuinely valued, not treated like a task robot. I take care of the people who take care of me\n\r\n\n\r\nActual work is roughly 3 hours a day — the rest of the time you're on-call but free. You're being paid for availability and reliability, not busywork\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll learn a ton — health optimization, travel planning, business operations.

I also have two big trips coming up (Dominican Republic next week  and France and Italy in March). I need someone who can take raw travel footage and make it scroll-stopping.\n\r\nProject 2: Wine Content - Wine education and wine travel content (combining sommelier-level expertise with travel).\n\r\nIf These Go Well (April Onward):\n\r\nAI Video Ad Training - You’d join me in learning an 8-week AI video ad creation program (valued at $5k, my discounted rate is $2k). We’d learn together how to create humor-leaning video ads for small businesses using cutting-edge AI tools.\n\r\nOnce you master this system, you’d be welcome to take on your own local clients using what you’ve learned. I’d focus on US clients (at higher rates), which means your pay would grow as we scale together.\n\r\nWhat I Need Right Now:\n\r\nSomeone who can look at raw footage and immediately see the story. I don’t want to have to explain every edit - I want someone who understands what makes people stop scrolling and can bring creative ideas to the table.\n\r\nSpecifically:\n\r\n ? Strong hooks (the first 3 seconds are everything)\n\r\n ? Good pacing and retention (keep people watching)\n\r\n ? Clean captions and text overlays\n\r\n ? Understanding of what performs on Reels/TikTok/Shorts\n\r\n ? Fast turnaround - I’m traveling soon and need content posted while it’s timely, not weeks later\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For:\n\r\n? Creative eye - Can spot interesting \nnts and turn them into engaging stories? Self-starter - Can work with direction but also bring your own ideas? Growth mindset - Excited to learn new AI tools and build high-value skills? Long-term thinker - This starts with travel content, but the goal is to grow together\n\r\nTo Apply - PLEASE INCLUDE:\n\r\n???? Portfolio: Links to 2-3 Reels, TikToks, or YouTube Shorts you’ve created (travel/lifestyle content preferred but not required)\n\r\n???? Tools: What editing software do you use? (CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, etc.)\n\r\n? Availability: How many hours per week can you commit?\n\r\n? Why you: What excites you about this opportunity specifically?\n\r\nApplications without portfolio links of some kind (even if it’s your personal Instagram) will not be reviewed.\n\r\nThis isn’t just a VA job - it’s a chance to learn high-value skills and grow your earning potential. If that excites you, I’d love to see your work!                ",

    "description": "\n                    VFX / Velocity Editor - Lethal Luxury Short-Form Video\n\r\n\n\r\n**Brand:** Prismiera (Luxury Jewelry)\n\r\n**Pay:** $1100 USD/month\n\r\n**Type:** Full-time, 40 hours/week\n\r\n**Location:** Remote (Philippines)\n\r\n**Software:** Premiere Pro + After Effects (mandatory)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Mission\n\r\n\n\r\nPrismiera is a pre-launch luxury jewelry brand launching a short-form video series - 35–50 second stories about mythology, history, spies, poisoners, queens, alchemists, and other on-brand topics posted across TikTok, Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe aesthetic is **History and mythology meets high fashion**. The editing energy is closer to a perfectly-timed **After Effects edit** than a corporate product video. Every cut serves the story.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will receive a script, a voiceover file, and a mood reference. Your job is to **build the scene from nothing**: generate AI visuals, voiceovers, source archival footage, layer sound design, and deliver a short where every second earns the next. A visual storyteller.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Style\n\r\n\n\r\n**YES:** Dark luxury. Museum. AE VFX edit. Stylish/Lethal. Rich textures. Clean typography. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention.\n\r\n\n\r\n**NO:** CapCut default presets. Anything that looks like a stock photo slideshow or a corporate deck.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that more effects does not necessarily mean better. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Core Skills (Non-Negotiables)\n\r\n\n\r\n**Motion Graphics** You can build scenes, transitions, and visual elements from scratch in After Effects - not just cut footage.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Voiceover-First Storytelling.** You are editing to a *narration* primarily, music track second. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate. You never bury the script's punchline under a flashy transition. The voice leads - the visuals serve.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Retention Instinct.** You understand that the first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually, not just with text overlays. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Rhythm & Beat-Sync.** You can sync cuts, zooms, and effects to music. You understand \"the drop.\" If you've made AMVs, fan/anime edits, or phonk edits, you already have this skill - we want you to apply it with restraint.\n\r\n\n\r\n**AI-Assisted Asset Creation.** You are comfortable generating images and short clips using tools like Midjourney or Kling. (We usually move onto new tools as soon as they are released). You treat AI as a production tool, not a novelty. We provide all paid accounts - you bring the creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Bonus Skills (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- After Effects compositing - Mocha tracking, light matching (future projects will involve product placement in video scenes)\n\r\n- Typography sense - fonts that feel intentional, never default\n\r\n- Color grading - pushing AI output and footage into a consistent palette\n\r\n- Sound design beyond music - layering SFX on movement, crafting risers and hits\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Weekly Output\n\r\n\n\r\n**Ramp-up (first 2–3 weeks):** 2–3 shorts as you learn the brand voice and pipeline.\n\r\n**Steady state:** 4–5 shorts per week at the locked quality standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work from clear creative briefs with reference scripts, mood boards, and audio clips for most batches.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**Do not send a generic cover letter.**\n\r\n\n\r\n**Subject line:** Lethal Editor - [Your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Send the following (in this order):**\n\r\n\n\r\n1. **The Story Test.** Link to ONE short-form video you edited that includes **voiceover or spoken dialogue**. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. **The AE Style Test.** Link to ONE video that shows your **visual rhythm and editing craft** - an AMV, fan edit, fashion reel, or anything where the editing itself is the skill. It doesn't need to be \"dark\" or \"luxury.\" It needs to show us how you think about pacing and impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. **AI Experience (1 sentence).** What is your experience level with generative AI tools (Midjourney, seedream, Kling, etc.)? If none, say so - we'll evaluate the rest of your application on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. **Hardware.** Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. **Turnaround Estimate.** How long does a 30–50 second high-quality short typically take you, start to finish?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. **The Rewrite.** Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and modern: *\"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"*\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Paid Trial (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial.

We help New Zealanders who have lost their driver’s licences get back on the road legally so they can keep their jobs and support their families.\n\r\n\n\r\nLosing a licence in NZ is a massive crisis for most people. We provide the \"pathway out\" by preparing their Limited Licence applications. \n\r\n\n\r\nOur new clients fill out an online form and then their data is automatically merged into our precedents. A detail orientated person then needs to revise the documents to turn the information that our clients have provided into polished and formatted court ready documents.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role:\n\r\nI am looking for a sharp, detail-obsessed Law Graduate (Juris Doctor) or a high-level Legal VA to join the team as a Legal Document Editor.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to take the drafts our system generates and give them a rigorous \"human polish.\" You’ll be ensuring that the Affidavits sound authentic, the Draft Orders are legally precise, and every single detail is accurate and correct.\n\r\n\n\r\nI presently have two staff based in New Zealand who handle the whole process. We are wanting to have someone dedicated to  the initial document so that we can focus on client management and the other elements in the application process/\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role will begin solely in document drafting but there is room for the role to grow into handling other aspects of the business.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll be doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nDocument Editing: Taking the raw data a client puts into our form and smoothing it out so it reads as a professional, sworn statement for a Judge.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Logic Check\": If a client says they work in Auckland but their driving route says Christchurch, you need to catch that. You are the filter that prevents embarrassing errors in court.\n\r\n\n\r\nFurther Information: Our clients frequently give us incomplete and poor answers. We need you to pick up on what further information would be required to complete the document.\n\r\n\n\r\nPolice/Court Readiness: Making sure the final PDF is formatted exactly how a Registrar or Police Prosecutor expects to see it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho you are:\n\r\n\n\r\nA Law Degree is a massive plus. If you've spent years reading and drafting motions or orders, you’ll find this work straightforward but rewarding.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are a \"Detail Hawk.\" You’re the type of person who gets annoyed by a misplaced comma or a inconsistent font.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand \"High Stakes.\" You know that if we get a driving hour wrong (e.g., 7am instead of 7pm), our client could end up in legal trouble. You take that responsibility seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\nNative-level English. Your writing should be indistinguishable from a New Zealand legal professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Setup:\n\r\n\n\r\nPay: Pay is dependent on qualifications and experience. If you are a JD who is over-qualified for \"general VA\" work, this may be a good role for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (The Attention Test):\n\r\nI get a lot of applications, so I only respond to those who follow these steps:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: \"Limited Licence Specialist - [your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nAttach a CV and an example document that you have drafted.\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m looking for a long-term partner who wants to help me scale this business as we grow.

You might just be our person. Welcome to your Ultimate career move!\n\r\n\n\r\n| ABOUT THE ROLE |\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring for one role and looking for a diamond. You are rare, and so are we. This Sales and Client Communication Strategy Consultant will join our long-term and well-established Filipino team at My Ultimate Events, Australia’s leading events company for hens, bucks, and team celebrations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not your standard sales role. It is fast paced, human first, and deeply strategic. You will be working as a Sales Pair with an Australian based consultant, where both of you are equal partners working toward shared goals while also owning your individual responsibilities within the pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this role, you will manage warm inbound leads and existing clients through fast, natural written communication and occasional phone calls with clients who are already working with us. Speed of lead is critical in this environment, and your ability to think fast, respond fast, and adapt fast will define your success.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will collaborate closely with your Australian partner, brainstorming, strategising, checking logic, and troubleshooting client scenarios together. And you will also work independently when needed, owning your workload, making sound decisions, and keeping the pipeline moving without requiring constant direction.\n\r\n\n\r\nThink like a problem solver, communicate like a human, and operate like a strategic sales partner. You will rely on templates where appropriate, but you will also know instinctively when a situation needs a tweak, a reword, or a more nuanced approach.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not filling a seat. We are searching for someone who is clever, warm, fast, thoughtful, witty, and capable of juggling multiple moving parts with accuracy, confidence, and very high attention to detail.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are 15 years established and operating across Australia, with a Filipino Australian team that has worked together long term.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe reward loyalty, invest in growth, and offer genuine long-term stability within an inspiring, high performance culture, with excellent training and a team of managers who genuinely want every person in the business to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly one role is available due to our sales department expanding.\n\r\n\n\r\n| CORE RESPONSIBILITIES |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work in a paired sales structure with an Australian Sales Consultant, collaborating daily, syncing strategies, and supporting shared goals while owning your individual responsibilities in the pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Respond to warm inbound leads quickly, naturally, and with real human connection. You must not rely on ChatGPT to do the work or the thinking for you. Spell check is fine, but the logic, strategy, and language must be your own genuine skillset.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Call clients back when needed to clarify details, answer questions, or support them through their existing booking journey.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Use templates as a foundation but adapt them when the situation calls for nuance, logic, or personalised communication.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Read between the lines of what clients really mean, not just what they type, and respond with warmth, intelligence, and strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Create customised event recommendations using persuasive, human centred communication.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Handle objections with logic, empathy, and confidence, focusing on clarity and problem solving rather than pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work at a very fast pace. Juggle multiple conversations and tasks while keeping accuracy and attention to detail consistently high.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Brainstorm solutions and sales approaches with your Australian partner, contributing ideas and helping refine strategies.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Think fast, solve problems in real time, and keep \nntum moving throughout the client journey.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Maintain CRM accuracy, manage your workload, and prioritise effectively in a dynamic environment.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WHO YOU ARE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Intelligent, human, fast thinking, and persuasive, with strong social intelligence.\n\r\n\n\r\n-A natural collaborator who enjoys bouncing ideas, refining strategies, and achieving results as a team, but also independent enough to operate confidently without constant guidance.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Able to rely on templates when appropriate, but also able to instinctively recognise when a situation needs a different angle, wording, or strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Comfortable on the phone with warm clients, confident speaking with both kindness and clarity.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Fast paced and energised by juggling multiple conversations and deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Emotionally intelligent and capable of understanding clients beyond the literal words they use.\n\r\n\n\r\n-High attention to detail. Spelling, logic, accuracy, tone, and data entry matter deeply to you.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Thrive in a high performance, strategy driven environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you need AI to write messages for you or think for you, this is not the role for you. You will be great somewhere else, but not here.\n\r\n\n\r\n| YOU MUST HAVE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Real sales or client facing experience where communication, problem solving, and human connection were essential.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Highly skilled in written English and able to write naturally, quickly, and with personality, without relying on AI to think for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Confident speaking to clients by phone when needed. All calls are warm leads or existing clients.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Experience working in partnership with a colleague or tea\nmber and comfortable sharing a pipeline, strategy, and daily collaboration.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Social intelligence and the ability to read what a client really means, not just what they say.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Experience using Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and CRM systems.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Strategic mindset and confidence handling multiple moving parts under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\n-A quiet home office, fast wired internet, and a Windows PC (not Mac)\n\r\n\n\r\n-Previous offshore experience with an Australian, US, or UK based company is an advantage.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WORK HOURS |\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease only apply if you can consistently commit to these exact hours every week. These are essential to match your Australian sales partner and maintain operational rhythm.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours Brisbane Time\n\r\n\n\r\nMonday to Friday 8am to 5pm Brisbane Time\n\r\n\n\r\nBrisbane is UTC+10 and does not use daylight savings.\n\r\n\n\r\n| SALARY AND BENEFITS |\n\r\n\n\r\n-50,000 to 60,000 PHP per month depending on experience and skill.\n\r\n\n\r\n-13th month pay.\n\r\n\n\r\n-All Filipino public holidays fully paid and you do not come to work.\n\r\n\n\r\n-15 days paid annual leave.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Team huddles, mentorship, collaboration, and a culture that celebrates growth, initiative, and performance.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Long-term, full time role with a trusted Australian company that genuinely invests in its team.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Amazing role with high level benefits.\n\r\n\n\r\n| ABOUT US |\n\r\n\n\r\nMy Ultimate Events is Australia’s leading events organisation for hens, bucks, and corporate team events.\n\r\nWe have been creating unforgettable experiences for over 15 years and have proudly built a strong, loyal Filipino Australian team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are bold, strategic, fun, and people focused. We celebrate wins, invest in growth, and value genuine collaboration and connection.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will not be a freelancer or a temp. You will be a valued part of a thriving company that values loyalty, excellence, emotional intelligence, and partnership.\n\r\n\n\r\n| HOW TO APPLY |\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application directly to \n to WOW us. We do not look at the Online Jobs inbox, so you must\n to be considered. Only those who include all of the below will be considered due to the high volume of applications.\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\n                    | ARE YOU THE DIAMOND WE ARE LOOKING FOR? |\n\r\n\n\r\nAmazing role with high level benefits! | Immediate / ASAP Start\n\r\n\n\r\nAre you bored with the same old jobs?\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you know that if you were in the right role, one where your organisation skills, attention to detail, and your ability to think logically beyond a process could truly shine, you would THRIVE?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, welcome. You might just be our person. Welcome to your Ultimate career move!\n\r\n\n\r\n| ABOUT THE ROLE |\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are hiring for one role and looking for a diamond. You are rare, and so are we.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Sales Operations and CRM Support Consultant will join our long term and well established Filipino team at My Ultimate Events, Australia’s leading events company for hens, bucks, and team celebrations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a high volume, fast paced, admin heavy role, but it is not a rigid, robotic, box ticking position.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work as a pair with an Australian based consultant, where both of you are equal partners working toward shared outcomes while owning clearly defined responsibilities within a very busy pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\nProcess matters here. CRM accuracy matters. Attention to detail is non negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\nBut so does thinking.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be expected to understand the logic behind the process, not just follow it blindly. When a situation falls outside the standard path, you must be able to assess, think, and apply judgement, knowing when to adapt, when to escalate, and when to pause and ask the right question.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpeed of lead matters. Accuracy matters. Logic matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will collaborate closely with your Australian partner, syncing daily, checking logic, flagging risks, and sense checking decisions. You will also work independently for large portions of the day, confidently managing your workload, making sound judgement calls, and keeping \nntum moving without constant instruction.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role sits at the intersection of structure and thinking. You must be comfortable operating within systems while also being able to step outside them when the situation genuinely requires it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not filling a seat. We are searching for someone who is organised, sharp, thoughtful, adaptable, and capable of handling complexity in a consistently busy environment.\n\r\n\n\r\n| CORE RESPONSIBILITIES |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work in a paired sales structure with an Australian Consultant, collaborating daily, aligning priorities, and supporting shared outcomes while owning your individual responsibilities within the pipeline.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Manage a very busy workload with multiple conversations, systems, and tasks running at once.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Maintain accurate, up to date CRM records at all times. Data accuracy, clean notes, and task tracking are essential.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Follow established processes while understanding the logic behind them, and apply judgement when a scenario does not fit neatly into the standard workflow.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Identify gaps, inconsistencies, or risks within client communication or bookings and think through the next best step, not just the next task.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Respond to warm inbound leads and existing clients clearly, naturally, and professionally via written communication and occasional phone calls.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Use templates and systems correctly, but adapt when clarity, tone, or logic requires a different approach.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Know when to proceed, when to escalate, and when to pause and seek clarification.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Work efficiently under pressure, maintaining quality and clear thinking during peak periods.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WHO YOU ARE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Highly organised and detail oriented, with strong respect for process and accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Equally capable of stepping outside a process to think logically and solve a problem when needed.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Comfortable making judgement calls within defined boundaries.\n\r\n\n\r\n-A strong written communicator who writes clearly, naturally, and with purpose.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Calm, grounded, and reliable in busy environments with competing priorities.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Confident working independently while collaborating closely with a partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Intellectually curious and motivated to understand the “why” behind how things are done.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Not someone who needs to be told every step, but also not someone who ignores structure.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are only comfortable following instructions without thinking, or if you prefer complete freedom without structure, this role will not be the right fit. We want someone who can do both.\n\r\n\n\r\n| YOU MUST HAVE |\n\r\n\n\r\n-Previous experience in an admin heavy, operations, sales support, or client coordination role that required judgement, not just task completion.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Strong written English and high attention to detail across spelling, tone, logic, and data entry.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Experience using CRM systems and working within defined workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Confidence speaking to clients by phone when required. All calls are warm or existing clients.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Strong time management skills and the ability to prioritise under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Experience using Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and CRM systems.\n\r\n\n\r\n-A quiet home office, fast wired internet, and a Windows PC (not Mac).\n\r\n\n\r\n-Previous offshore experience with an Australian, US, or UK based company is an advantage.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WORK HOURS |\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease only apply if you can consistently commit to these exact hours every week. These are essential to match your Australian sales partner and maintain operational rhythm.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours Brisbane Time\n\r\n\n\r\nMonday to Friday 9am to 6pm Brisbane Time\n\r\n\n\r\nBrisbane is UTC+10 and does not use daylight savings.\n\r\n\n\r\n| SALARY AND BENEFITS |\n\r\n\n\r\n-50,000 to 60,000 PHP per month depending on experience and skill.\n\r\n\n\r\n-13th month pay.\n\r\n\n\r\n-All Filipino public holidays fully paid and you do not come to work.\n\r\n\n\r\n-15 days paid annual leave.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Team huddles, training, mentorship, and operational support.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Long term, full time role with a trusted Australian company that genuinely invests in its team.\n\r\n\n\r\n-Amazing role with high level benefits.\n\r\n\n\r\n| ABOUT US |\n\r\n\n\r\nMy Ultimate Events is Australia’s leading events organisation for hens, bucks, and corporate team events.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have been creating unforgettable experiences for over 15 years and have proudly built a strong, loyal Filipino Australian team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe value reliability, clarity, initiative, and intelligent execution. We expect people to think, not just follow.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will not be a freelancer or a temp. You will be a valued part of a thriving company that values loyalty, excellence, and long term partnership.\n\r\n\n\r\n| HOW TO APPLY |\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application directly to \n to WOW us. We do not look at the Online Jobs inbox, so you must\n to be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease only apply if you genuinely enjoy roles that require both structure and thinking.\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n\n\r\nA personalised video telling us why you are the right fit for a role that combines process discipline with independent judgement.\n\r\n\n\r\nA cover letter outlining your admin, CRM, or sales support experience and an example of when you had to think beyond a process to solve a problem. This must be written by you, not AI.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour CV.\n\r\n\n\r\nConfirmation of your PC specs, internet speed, and workspace setup.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are detail oriented, logical, adaptable, and ready for a long term role where both accuracy and thinking matter, we cannot wait to meet you.\n\r\n\n\r\n| WELCOME TO YOUR ULTIMATE CAREER MOVE | We cannot wait to hear from you!!! |                ",

For a smart, motivated person, this role will be more stimulating than a traditional virtual assistant role.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSCHEDULE\n\r\n9:00am - 6:00 PM PST (Los Angeles time) Monday - Friday \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nGROWTH:\n\r\nPayment increases over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are outstanding, long-term there may also be the opportunity to be promoted into a leadership role\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTRAINING:\n\r\nYou'll receive basic training but many things you'll need to figure out on the fly.

This is more challenging than just following strict templates, but also more stimulating and exciting.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Impact: your actions will have a big impact on the business, which you will clearly see\n\r\n\n\r\n• Feedback: your feedback on what we are doing well, and what could be better, is not only valued, but is mandatory! We want everyone here thinking as if they were the business owner.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU:\n\r\n• Excellent written English (show this in your application!)\n\r\n• Coding experience\n\r\n• Technical - great with computers\n\r\n• Good listener - only needs to be told once\n\r\n• Strong communicator (you must OVERcommunicate with management and tea\nmbers)\n\r\n• Smart, quick learner\n\r\n• Fastidious - attention to detail\n\r\n• Decent at basic math\n\r\n• Pro-active - anticipates what may be helpful and goes above and beyond to contribute\n\r\n• Meticulous, organized, methodical.\n\r\n• Reliable! Always shows up and focuses.\n\r\n• Critical, creative thinker. Not robotic. Always looking for better ways to do things. Always considering all the angles of a task.\n\r\n• Willing to share your opinion - we NEED to hear your opinions\n\r\n• Able to ask clarifying questions in order to get tasks right the first time\n\r\n• Always eager to improve yourself and the company’s systems. Habitually thinks strategically and takes action for improvements.\n\r\n• Self-starter\n\r\n• Independent decision maker\n\r\n• Flexible - can quickly adjust on the fly\n\r\n• Comfortable with excel\n\r\n• Fast computer\n\r\n• Fast, dependable Internet\n\r\n• Bonus if you have experience or interest in salsa or bachata!\n\r\n\n\r\nAPPLY NOW. FORMAT YOUR APPLICATION AS A NUMBERED LIST WITH THE FOLLOWING:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A brief intro about yourself\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Can you work the hours requested?\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Complete this form: \n/\n.

    "description": "\n                    About RDBC\n\r\nRDBC makes world-class ballet training accessible to serious dancers anywhere. Our families and students expect a premium experience — the kind where someone remembers their name, anticipates what they need, and handles problems before they even notice.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone who runs that experience every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\nApply here: \n\r\n\n\r\nAbout This Role\n\r\nThis is not a ticket queue. There is no \"average handle time.\" You won't be reading from a script while someone waits on hold.\n\r\nYou'll be the person who makes sure a nervous parent gets the right answer in one message. The person who notices a teacher's Zoom isn't connecting and fixes it before class starts. The person who sees a promising lead sitting in the inbox and moves it forward — not because someone told you to, but because you know it matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you've worked somewhere that charged a premium and expected the service to match — a boutique studio, a private school, a concierge-level program, a high-touch online business — you already know what this feels like.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf your experience is mostly large-scale chat support, help desks, or call centers, this probably isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Own\n\r\n- Live class operations. You host and co-host Zoom sessions for real students in real time. Meetings start on time. Students land in the right room. Teachers are supported. When something breaks, you fix it live — not after the class is over.\n\r\n- Client support that feels personal. You answer\ns and DMs from dancers and parents. You have scripts and FAQs to work from, but you know when to go off-script because the situation calls for a human, not a template. 95% of simple tickets answered within 15 minutes. 80% resolved on the first reply.\n\r\n- Lead follow-through. When someone asks about our programs, you respond quickly, ask the right qualifying questions, send the right information, and route them to the next step. Nothing sits. Nothing gets lost. Every lead is logged.\n\r\n- Clean systems. Attendance submitted same-day. Class reports filed. Checklists followed. When you spot a pattern — the same question keeps coming in, the same step keeps breaking — you flag it so the system gets better.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Winning Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\n- 100% of your classes start on time with zero access issues escalated to the founder.\n\r\n- Support replies are fast, accurate, and feel like they came from someone who cares.\n\r\n- Zero leads go unlogged or unacknowledged.\n\r\n- You follow the playbook and you improve it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is For\n\r\n\n\r\n- You have 4+ years supporting clients (not \"users\") in a high-touch environment — a boutique studio, private school, premium online program, or service business where people expected more and you delivered it. US-based experience required.\n\r\n- Your written English is sharp. You write the way a trusted staff member talks — clear, warm, professional. No corporate filler.\n\r\n- You're comfortable with Zoom,\n, DMs, Notion, and spreadsheets. You pick up new tools fast.\n\r\n- You work Monday through Saturday on a consistent schedule aligned with live class times.\n\r\n- You don't need to be told to follow up. You notice what's slipping and you catch it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is NOT For\n\r\n\n\r\n- If your background is primarily call centers, high-volume chat support, or ticket-based helpdesks, this role will feel very different from what you're used to, and it's probably not the right match.\n\r\n- If you need detailed instructions for every situation before you act, you'll struggle here. We give you structure and frameworks, but we need someone who can think on their feet when a class is live and something goes sideways.                ",
