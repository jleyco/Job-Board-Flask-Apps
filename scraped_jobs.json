    "description": "\n                    Kumusta! \n\r\n\n\r\nYou might call yourself a full-stack developer or backend engineer today. We think that role is changing fast —\n\r\nand we're looking for someone who's already feeling it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a small Dutch tech company building ComChamp — the central nervous system for organisations. Today\n\r\nit's a CRM and Customer Journey Orchestration platform: a contact database, configurable multi-step\n\r\nworkflows, and multi-channel interactions — all in one system. Our clients are energy and telecom companies\n\r\nin the Netherlands who use it to run everything from lead intake to proposals to service delivery, without\n\r\nstitching five tools together.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhere it's going: an Agentic Communication Hub — where AI agents handle routine interactions, hand off to\n\r\nhumans for complex ones, and operate within the same journeys and audit trails. Same workflow, executed by a\n\r\nperson or an AI. That's what we're building toward.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur team is 10 people. Our codebase is 25+ TypeScript microservices. And we're growing.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat this role actually is\n\r\n********************\n\r\nWe don't need someone to write code line by line. AI does that now — and we use it extensively. What we need\n\r\nis someone who can think clearly about what to build, direct AI to build it, and know when it's getting it\n\r\nwrong.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat means:\n\r\n- You understand how systems connect — databases, APIs, queues, state management — not at the syntax\n\r\nlevel, but at the \"why is this architected this way\" level\n\r\n- You can look at an AI-generated solution and smell when something is off\n\r\n- You can break a messy business problem into clean, executable steps\n\r\n- You can explain a complex idea simply — to a teammate, to a client, to an AI\n\r\n- This is a product role as much as an engineering role. You'll think about what users need, how workflows\n\r\nshould behave, and where the system should be smarter. Then you'll make it happen — with AI as your primary\n\r\ntool.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you bring\n\r\n*************\n\r\nMust-haves:\n\r\n- Strong understanding of backend systems (we use NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, but we care more about\n\r\ndepth than specific frameworks)\n\r\n- Experience working with AI coding tools — Cursor, Claude, Copilot, or similar\n\r\n- Clear written and spoken English — this is non-negotiable, it's how we work\n\r\n- The ability to think at the product level, not just the ticket level\n\r\n\n\r\nGreat to have:\n\r\n- Experience with workflow engines, state machines, or process automation\n\r\n- Familiarity with Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Redis, or GCP\n\r\n- Interest in AI agents and autonomous systems — not as hype, but as real engineering problems\n\r\n\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we offer\n\r\n************\n\r\n- $15/hr USD — paid reliably, every time\n\r\n- Long-term contract — we're not looking for a quick project, we're building a team\n\r\n- Real ownership — you'll influence what we build and how\n\r\n- Small team, big ambitions — your work directly shapes the product\n\r\n- Work with people who think differently about what software teams will look like\n\r\n\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\n***********\n\r\nDon't just send a CV. Write us a short message (a few paragraphs is fine) that answers two things:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What's something complex that you understand really well? Could be technical, could be anything.\n\r\nExplain it to us like we know nothing about it.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Why does this role interest you? Not a generic answer — what specifically about how we described this\n\r\nmade you want to respond?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe read every application. The way you write your response tells us more than your resume.\n\r\n\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're building infrastructure for a world where AI and humans collaborate on real business operations —\n\r\nwhere small teams operate at enterprise scale. If that excites you, we'd love to hear from you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About Generation Success\n\r\n\n\r\nGeneration Success is a social impact organisation focused on social mobility, connecting young people from underrepresented backgrounds to white-collar employment opportunities. We work at the intersection of early careers, employer readiness, and systemic access — helping future-ready diverse talent reach the professional world, and helping employers build the workplace of tomorrow.\n\r\nWe are a small, ambitious team of six currently navigating a critical survival-to-scale phase. Our CEO, James Adeleke, also serves on the Education Board for the City of London Corporation and is a recognised voice in social mobility and early careers development. This role sits at the centre of the organisation.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nThis is not a typical EA role. You will be the operational backbone behind a founder-CEO who balances strategic leadership, external board commitments, daily content creation, and the demands of building a mission-driven organisation with a young family.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need to be someone who can anticipate what James needs before he asks, protect his time fiercely, and keep the operational machinery running so he can focus on the work that only he can do: strategy, partnerships, thought leadership, and external representation.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe right person will thrive in ambiguity, take ownership without being asked, and understand that in a team of six, everyone does whatever is necessary to move the mission forward.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Responsibilities\n\r\n1. Diary & Time Management\n\r\n - Own and manage James's calendar — scheduling, rescheduling, and protecting focus time\n\r\n - Coordinate meetings across multiple stakeholders including corporate partners, advisory board members, the City of London Corporation, and internal team\n\r\n - Proactively manage scheduling conflicts and ensure adequate preparation time between meetings\n\r\n - Protect James's structured morning routines (meditation, journaling, brain training, content creation) by ensuring no early-morning scheduling intrusions\n\r\n\n\r\n2.\n & Communications Management\n\r\n- Triage and manage James's\n inbox — categorise, flag, draft responses, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks\n\r\n- Draft replies and correspondence in James's voice and tone\n\r\n- Manage LinkedIn messages and inbox — respond to all messages (not just sales) in a timely, professional manner\n\r\n- Flag urgent items and escalate decisions that require James's direct input\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Operational Support\n\r\n- Prepare meeting agendas, briefing notes, and follow-up action summaries\n\r\n- Support document preparation and formatting for board packs, partner proposals, and strategic documents\n\r\n- Coordinate logistics for events including Open Your Doors Day, careers days, and roundtables\n\r\n- Manage Asana tasks and project tracking — ensure deadlines are met and nothing stalls\n\r\n- Support the team with ad hoc administrative, research, and coordination tasks as needed\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Content & Thought Leadership Support\n\r\n- Support James's daily LinkedIn content creation process — scheduling, light editing, engagement tracking\n\r\n- Assist with preparation for speaking engagements, panel discussions, and board meetings\n\r\n- Help coordinate thought leadership outputs including white papers, research briefs, and partnership communications\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Family-Aware Flexibility\n\r\n- Understand and accommodate the reality that James has a young family (3-year-old and baby) — emergencies happen, and this role requires someone who can hold the fort calmly\n\r\n- Provide cover on scheduling and communications when James is managing family commitments\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout You\n\r\n\n\r\nEssential\n\r\n- Exceptional organisational skills — you are the kind of person who brings order to chaos\n\r\n- Strong written communication — you can draft professional\ns, LinkedIn messages, and correspondence that sound like they came from someone senior\n\r\n- Proactive mindset — you anticipate needs and act before being asked\n\r\n- Comfortable with ambiguity — in a small team, your job description is a starting point, not a boundary\n\r\n- Discretion and trustworthiness — you will have access to sensitive strategic, financial, and partnership information\n\r\n- Confident using digital tools — Google Workspace, Asana, LinkedIn, Zoom, and willingness to learn new platforms quickly\n\r\n- Genuine alignment with GS's mission — social mobility, early careers, and creating opportunity for young people from underrepresented backgrounds\n\r\n\n\r\nDesirable\n\r\n- Experience supporting a founder or senior executive in a startup or small organisation\n\r\n- Familiarity with CRM systems (Go High Level or similar)\n\r\n- Experience with social media management, particularly LinkedIn\n\r\n- Comfort with AI tools — we use AI extensively across the organisation and expect tea\nmbers to leverage these tools\n\r\n- Understanding of the social impact, education, or early careers sector\n\r\n- Sales support experience — some commercial activities may be part of the role depending on team structure\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Not Looking For\n\r\nThis role is not for someone who needs detailed instructions for every task, waits to be told what to do, or sees their responsibilities as limited to a fixed list. We need someone who sees a gap, fills it, and then tells us about it afterwards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Generation Success\n\r\n- Mission that matters: Every day, your work directly contributes to opening doors for young people who wouldn't otherwise have access\n\r\n- Direct access to leadership: You work alongside the CEO, not three layers below — your impact is immediate and visible\n\r\n- Growth stage exposure: GS is at a critical inflection point — you'll see and contribute to what it takes to scale a social enterprise\n\r\n- Flexibility: Remote working with genuine flexibility — we care about output, not hours logged\n\r\n- Network access: Exposure to corporate partners, City of London Corporation, advisory board members, and the broader social mobility ecosystem\n\r\n- AI-forward culture: We don't just talk about AI — we use it daily. You'll develop skills that are increasingly valuable across every industry\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease send your CV and a short cover note (no more than 300 words) explaining why this role interests you and what makes you the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your cover note, please address:\n\r\n1. A specific example of a time you anticipated a problem before it became one\n\r\n2. How you organise your own work and priorities\n\r\n3. Why GS's mission resonates with you                ",

    "description": "\n                    *This is not a regular or entry-level VA role*.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for an exceptionally competent, detail-oriented Virtual Assistant to support the operations of a fast-growing online business led by a high-profile creator and legal professional.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a basic VA role. We need someone who thinks ahead, catches inconsistencies, understands priorities, and treats deadlines and accuracy as non-negotiable. You will be trusted with owning real responsibility across admin, sponsor coordination, affiliate support, and internal operations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be ready to be online at varying hours as our team is global and shifts timezones regularly. There are also occasions where urgent tasks require you to be online at alternate hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care less about your past experience and more about your desire to do things properly and carefully.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are the type of person who double-checks everything, asks smart clarifying questions, thinks 2 steps ahead, always has a plan B, always wants to improve with feedback, and genuinely cares about doing things well and finding a role they can grow with, this role may be a great fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term position for the right person, with a competitive starting rate and a strong roadmap to increase your salary over time, along with annual bonuses, each according to your performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n- Administrative support across multiple business areas (sponsorships, affiliates, internal operations, customer service, brand communications)\n\r\n- Managing and coordinating\n communications and reports with external partners (brands, sponsors, affiliates)\n\r\n- Focus on KPIs and keeping yourself and team on track with goals. Flagging when we are not on track, showing us how to get back on track, and actioning on that.\n\r\n- Flexibility in managing schedules and jumping in for urgent or important out-of-hours situations for campaigns and events.\n\r\n- Tracking deadlines, deliverables, and follow-ups with extreme accuracy, keeping yourself and the team accountable and catching mistakes before they become serious\n\r\n- Supporting internal programs and communities (including memberships and customer support routing)\n\r\n- Executing tasks based on SOPs while also flagging issues, gaps, or potential improvements\n\r\n- Communicating clearly and proactively when something does not make sense or needs clarification\n\r\n- Ensuring nothing slips through the cracks, impeccable organization\n\r\n- We care far more about how you think and work, and your drive to grow and improve, than your exact past job titles and experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are likely a strong fit if you are:\n\r\n- Extremely detail-oriented and careful with timelines, instructions, and communication\n\r\n- Highly responsible, reliable, and consistently on time\n\r\n- Ready to commit to a full-time, long-term role\n\r\n- Flexible to switch shifts to accommodate meetings and campaigns that run over different timezones\n\r\n- Proactive and thoughtful (you notice problems before they become problems) and take action to get yourself and our team back on track\n\r\n- Comfortable juggling multiple priorities without losing accuracy\n\r\n- Trustworthy, discreet, and professional\n\r\n- Genuinely invested in doing good work and growing long-term in a role\n\r\n- Someone who takes ownership rather than just “completing tasks”\n\r\n- Have a talent for communicating efficiently with C-level executives and clients\n\r\n- Backgrounds that often do well in this role include (but are not limited to):\n\r\n- Paralegal or legal assistant\n\r\n- Executive assistant for a high-profile individual\n\r\n- C-level operations or high-stakes admin roles requiring high precision\n\r\n- Any role where mistakes had real consequences\n\r\n- Experience with online tools is a plus, but not required if you are a fast learner. We have strong SOPs and clear processes in place.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Style & Expectations:\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Long-term role (not a short-term gig or a part-time gig)\n\r\n- Clear communication and accountability are essential\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be trained, but you are expected to think independently and ultimately be the one owning and building your own SOPs, projects, and campaigns\n\r\n\n\r\nQuality and accuracy matter more than speed\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not a fit if you:\n\r\n- Want a basic admin job\n\r\n- Are not comfortable with flexible hours or be on standby for certain times\n\r\n- Want something short-term\n\r\n- Are not eager to grow your career long-term\n\r\n- Are not confident in an English business environment\n\r\n- Are not comfortable with tech and learning tech\n\r\n\n\r\nTrial Process\n\r\n- Shortlisted candidates may be asked to complete a paid trial period (1–2 weeks) to ensure a strong mutual fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please fill in the application form:\n                ",

About Us:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a professional training organization based in the UK, delivering National Qualifications (City & Guilds/NVQ). We don't just sell \"courses\"; we certify professionals.
