    "description": "\n                    Executive Assistant to Founder (Long-Term)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nREAD THIS ENTIRE POST BEFORE APPLYING\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a typical VA job. If you're looking for easy, low-stress work with flexible deadlines, this is not for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me be direct about what you're signing up for.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO I AM\n\r\n\n\r\nI run multiple businesses simultaneously. I've hit capacity and need to delegate. I need someone who can take work OFF my plate—not add to it.\n\r\n\n\r\nI don't need someone who can \"help.\" I need someone who can EXECUTE.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE BRUTAL TRUTH ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me be upfront about the hard parts:\n\r\n\n\r\nMinimal hand-holding. You'll receive clear instructions and context for each task—but I won't walk you through every step. I'll give you the outcome I need. You figure out how to get there.\n\r\n\n\r\nEmergencies happen. If something critical breaks at 3am your time, we handle it. If a deadline is tomorrow, you stay up and get it done. This isn't every day, but when it happens, I need 100% reliability.\n\r\n\n\r\nDirect feedback. When you make mistakes (everyone does), I'll tell you directly. No sugarcoating. If you're the type who takes feedback personally instead of using it to improve, this won't work.\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh failure rate. If 10 people start a trial, expect 1-2 to make it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY WOULD ANYONE WANT THIS JOB?\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what you get:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Direct access to a founder, not middle management.\n\r\nYou'll see how decisions are made at the top across multiple businesses. You'll learn by doing, not by watching.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Clear path to Executive Assistant ? Right-Hand Person.\n\r\nI'm not looking for a task-rabbit. I'm looking for someone who can eventually run things when I'm not around.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Trust and autonomy once earned.\n\r\nMicromanagement is exhausting for both of us. Prove yourself, and I'll give you the keys. I want to eventually hand off entire areas of responsibility—operating as my right hand, making decisions on my behalf.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Compensation grows with performance.\n\r\nStarting rate post-probation is $3/hr. Performance is rewarded—raises and bonuses are on the table as you take on more responsibility.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT I NEED FROM YOU\n\r\n\n\r\nNon-negotiables:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Minimum 2+ years VA experience (no exceptions—I don't have time to train basics)\n\r\n• Excellent written AND spoken English (you'll be coordinating with other Filipino freelancers on my team, and we'll work together via Zoom calls—all communication is in English)\n\r\n• Available for Zoom calls when needed (camera on, clear audio)\n\r\n• Reliable internet and backup plan if it goes down\n\r\n• Wise account for payments\n\r\n\n\r\nThe mindset I'm looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\n• You have a high work ethic and thrive on getting things done\n\r\n• You're career-first—this isn't a side gig\n\r\n• You take ownership. \"That's not my job\" isn't in your vocabulary\n\r\n• You're resourceful. AI is your friend. You solve problems before escalating\n\r\n• You can handle pressure without crumbling\n\r\n• You're direct. Shy and timid won't work here\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm in the middle of launching a startup. There's a mountain of tasks that need to get done, and I can't do them all myself. Your job is to take items off my plate and execute them.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis will vary week to week. Some examples:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Completing assignments and action items I delegate\n\r\n• Following up on tasks and keeping things moving\n\r\n• Organizing information, documents, and files\n\r\n• Communicating with tea\nmbers on my behalf\n\r\n• Handling whatever needs to get done to move the business forward\n\r\n\n\r\nThe work isn't predictable or repetitive. If you need a clearly defined job description with the same tasks every day, this isn't it.\n\r\n\n\r\nEventually (if you prove yourself):\n\r\n\n\r\n• Taking ownership of entire workstreams\n\r\n• Making decisions on my behalf\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION & STRUCTURE\n\r\n\n\r\n• Position type: Part-time\n\r\n• Trial period: 2 weeks (fixed-fee per task)\n\r\n• Probation period: Up to 3 months after passing trial (fixed-fee per task)\n\r\n• Post-probation: Converted to hourly ($3/hr starting rate)\n\r\n• Advancement: Executive Assistant promotion available based on performance, with compensation to match\n\r\n• Timezone: PST\n\r\n• Payment: Wise, bi-weekly\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application via \n DM \n\r\n\n\r\nTo confirm you've read this entire post, begin your cover letter with: \"Time is the one resource we can't make more of.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that don't start with this phrase will be automatically rejected.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Your resume/CV\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Answer these two questions:\n\r\n   • \"Describe a real situation where you handled an urgent, high-pressure task outside of normal working hours. What happened and what did you do?\"\n\r\n   • \"If I gave you a task with unclear instructions, what would you do?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Screenshot of your 16 Personalities test results: \n\r\n\n\r\n4. Screenshot of your DISC personality assessment results: \n\r\n\n\r\n5. Your Wise\n (for paid trial tasks if selected)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong applicants will be contacted for next steps, which may include an interview and paid trial assignments.

You won’t just audit pages and hand off recommendations—you’ll own the full optimization cycle: diagnosing conversion leaks, architecting higher-performing pages, and using AI tools (primarily Claude) to rapidly prototype, design, and code upgraded landing page experiences.\n\r\nThis role is for someone who thinks like a strategist, executes like a builder, and communicates like a creative director. You’ll screenshot our existing pages, sit with AI to reimagine them, produce polished visual plans, and deliver ready-to-implement page blueprints that move customers from scroll to sale.\n\r\nWHAT YOU’LL OWN\n\r\nYou’ll be responsible for the complete CRO roadmap across our ecommerce storefront, including but not limited to:\n\r\n\n\r\nHome Page Redesign — Structure the hero, trust signals, navigation flow, and CTAs to maximize click-through and session depth.\n\r\nStep Funnel Optimization — Map and refine every stage of the purchase funnel—from first click to checkout confirmation—eliminating friction at each transition.\n\r\nBOGO Offer Pages (Multiple Variants) — Build toggle-scroll layouts with strategic upsell placements for BOGO 1, BOGO 2, and hybrid bundle offers (e.g., Buy 1 Mat Get 2 Ropes Free).\n\r\nCollections & Bundle Architecture — Redesign the All Collections page plus unique collection experiences for Pre-Built Bundles, Ropes, Gears, and other product categories.\n\r\nMembership / Free Trial Funnel — Architect the Timeless Jump Club free trial flow—from hook to sign-up to upsell—so it converts browsers into committed members.\n\r\nBrand Story & Trust Pages — Optimize “Why Timeless” and “About Our Story” pages to build emotional connection and credibility that supports conversion across the entire site.\n\r\nCORE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\nAudit existing pages by screenshotting them and running structured AI-driven analysis sessions using Claude to identify conversion gaps, UX weaknesses, and missed revenue opportunities.\n\r\nPrompt Claude to generate improved layouts, copy hierarchy, visual wireframes, and front-end code for landing pages, funnels, and offer pages.\n\r\nProduce full-scope CRO plans for each page—including annotated before/after visuals, strategic rationale, and implementation specs—then present them to the team.\n\r\nDesign and optimize upsell flows, toggle-scroll mechanics, and bundle page architecture that maximize AOV without degrading the customer experience.\n\r\nContinuously A/B test, iterate, and refine based on data—heatmaps, session recordings, GA4, and platform analytics.\n\r\nCollaborate cross-functionally with creative, media buying, and product teams to ensure CRO insights feed back into the broader growth engine.\n\r\nAI & CLAUDE PROFICIENCY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n\r\nThis is not a “nice to have.” Your daily workflow will involve:\n\r\nScreenshotting live pages and feeding them into Claude with structured prompts to extract actionable optimization insights.\n\r\nPrompting Claude to generate high-fidelity visual concepts, interactive mockups, and production-ready front-end code (HTML/CSS/Liquid/React).\n\r\nBuilding and refining prompt frameworks that consistently produce professional-grade outputs—not rough drafts.\n\r\nUsing Claude to rapidly iterate on page variations, test copy angles, and simulate customer decision paths before pushing live.\n\r\nIf you’ve never sat with an AI tool for hours building real deliverables, this role will feel foreign. If you’ve done it and loved it, keep reading.\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n3+ years of hands-on ecommerce CRO experience (DTC / Shopify / headless preferred).\n\r\nProven track record of improving conversion rates, AOV, and revenue per session through page-level optimization.\n\r\nDeep familiarity with landing page best practices: visual hierarchy, offer framing, urgency/scarcity mechanics, social proof placement, and mobile-first design.\n\r\nStrong working knowledge of analytics tools: GA4, Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity, or equivalent heatmap/session recording platforms.\n\r\nDemonstrable experience using Claude (or comparable AI) to produce visual designs, code, and strategic plans—not just text chat.\n\r\nAbility to communicate optimization plans clearly with annotated visuals, strategic write-ups, and structured presentations.\n\r\nComfortable working in a fast-paced, results-driven environment where shipping beats perfection.\n\r\nBONUS POINTS\n\r\nExperience with Shopify Liquid, custom theme development, or headless CMS builds.\n\r\nBackground in direct-response copywriting or offer architecture.\n\r\nFamiliarity with subscription/membership funnel optimization.\n\r\nExperience managing or mentoring junior CRO or design tea\nmbers.\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nSend us a short Loom (under 5 minutes) where you screenshot one of our live pages, walk us through what’s broken, and show us how you’d use Claude to fix it. That’s worth more than any resume.\n\r\nInclude your portfolio or case studies showing before/after CRO results on ecommerce pages.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don’t need someone who knows CRO theory. We need someone who builds pages that sell.                ",

You'll be paid to learn everything needed on the job. This is a bit of an odd job posting. Allow me to explain.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm a highly paid AI researcher based in San Francisco. I have many business ideas relating to AI that could be quite successful, but I don't have the time to pursue them. My hope here is to find people I can supervise to try some of the ideas I don't have time for. I'm fine with people who are inexperienced but smart and hungry to learn. I can direct learning quite effectively, I think. Several of my friends run multimillion dollar companies, I have a good grasp of what's necessary here and I don't see any reason why someone motivated can't learn, given time and quality direction. You'll be learning about AI, how money works, marketing, sales, etc. You'll handle the majority of execution with my mentorship.\n\r\n\n\r\nSend me evidence of:\n\r\n- Learning quickly\n\r\n- Work ethic. Character. Honesty.\n\r\n- The ability to execute towards a goal by yourself, not only doing what you're told. Creativity.\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking for several people to do this as their main focus, I can bump the number of hours if needed. Note that I'm looking for people I can work with long-term. The real gains will start to show up after 3 months of intensive learning.\n\r\n\n\r\nI've kept the salary near the low end at $3/hr as a nudge towards people who value learning and believe in their own success.

Content Creation\n\r\n• Write clear, polished descriptions for publication on our website\n\r\n• Translate technical or confusing features into plain English contractors understand\n\r\n• Organize content consistently so contractors can quickly answer:\n\r\n• “Is this for me?”\n\r\n• “Is this worth the cost?”\n\r\n?\n\r\n????

Our brands, Plastair, DeeVa, and PlastairFyre, are built on differentiated products, strong margins, and when appropriate, utility patents or design patents. We manufacture in Canada, or source electronics overseas, then protect and position them properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have a strong presence in brick and mortar retail in North America for decades.

It’s for someone who can own\n operations end-to-end.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nPrimary Responsibilities (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n\n\r\n1) GoHighLevel\n Campaigns + Sequences (Core)\n\r\n • Build and manage:\n\r\n • Launch sequence\ns\n\r\n • Nurture\ns (pre-launch)\n\r\n • Post-purchase onboarding\ns\n\r\n • Create and manage\n templates to match brand style (simple, clean formatting).\n\r\n\n\r\n2) Automations + Segmentation (Core)\n\r\n • Build workflows using:\n\r\n • Tags, triggers, segmentation\n\r\n • If/then logic (buyer vs non-buyer, clicked vs not clicked, etc.)\n\r\n • Maintain list hygiene and ensure contacts flow into the correct paths.\n\r\n\n\r\n3) QA + Deliverability Basics (Core)\n\r\n • Test all links, buttons, personalization fields, and mobile formatting.\n\r\n • Verify correct automation behavior with test contacts.\n\r\n • Ensure\ns send at correct times with correct conditions.\n\r\n\n\r\n4) Execution Tracking + Reporting (Core)\n\r\n • Maintain a simple tracker:\n\r\n •\n name ? status ? send date ? owner ? links ? QA complete\n\r\n • Provide short written updates: Done / Next / Blocked.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nSecondary Responsibilities \n\r\n • Webinar reminder automation logic (registration ? reminders ? replay)\n\r\n • Light funnel page edits inside GoHighLevel (if we use it)\n\r\n • Coordination with assets (graphics/video links) to support\n campaigns\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nNon-Negotiables (How We Work)\n\r\n • Strong QA mindset (broken links, wrong sends, missed segments = unacceptable)\n\r\n • Fast communication during launch windows\n\r\n • You follow naming conventions and keep Drive organized\n\r\n • You don’t disappear — you flag blockers early\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nHours + Availability\n\r\n • Part-time to start (10–15 hrs/week depending on the week)\n\r\n • Must be available for 1–2 coordination calls/week (PH time)\n\r\n • Launch weeks: must be responsive within 4–6 hours during key send windows\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nTools We Use\n\r\n • GoHighLevel\n\r\n • Google Drive\n\r\n • Canva (templates provided for basic formatting needs)\n\r\n • Zoom (handoff recordings)\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\n • Existing GoHighLevel account audited + mapped (what exists, what’s missing)\n\r\n • Launch\n calendar drafted + first workflows built\n\r\n • QA testing started with test contacts\n\r\n\n\r\n • Launch sequences finalized + QA complete\n\r\n • Segmentation clean (buyers/non-buyers, click paths)\n\r\n •\n execution stable + ready for scaling\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nBonus / Additional Skills (Optional but a Big Plus)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile this role is primarily focused on GoHighLevel\n + automations, if you also have experience in project management for course and webinar creation, please mention it. Specifically:\n\r\n • Coordinating webinar build timelines (outline ? slides ?\ns/reminders ? QA)\n\r\n • Coordinating course build timelines (asset lists, uploads, testing/QA)\n\r\n • Managing deliverables across multiple owners (design, video, written assets)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have these skills, there may be an opportunity to expand your scope over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\nHow to Apply (Follow Exactly)\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your message with: PHOENIX and include:\n\r\n 1. Summary of your GoHighLevel\n experience (campaigns, templates, workflows).\n\r\n 2. Example of an\n automation you’ve built (describe the logic + outcome).\n\r\n 3. Your weekly availability (PH time).\n\r\n 4. Your hourly rate (USD).\n\r\n 5. Answer briefly:\n\r\nIn GoHighLevel, what’s the difference between a Trigger and a Workflow?\n\r\nIf you can’t share screenshots due to confidentiality, describe your work clearly and what you owned end-to-end.\n\r\nYour Availability and relevant work experience                ",
