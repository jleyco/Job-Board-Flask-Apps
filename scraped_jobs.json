    "description": "\n                    We're a company who owns several brands, mostly pets and kitchen stuff (not an agency) - we currently have 5 video editors and we need 1 more!\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat are we looking for?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're looking for someone who wants to learn how to be a video editor that knows how to make videos that CONVERT - maybe you know how to make videos that look cute, great. The problem is that cute videos don't make you a lot of money. We will teach you how to make videos that convert because we're a company that is high volume sales.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we are offering?\n\r\n\n\r\n- $1000/month for 3 months.\n\r\n- $1300 after 3 months.\n\r\n- Monday to Friday - 8 hours per day. Have full weekends off - after 3 months, the schedule is very flexible and you can move hours around.\n\r\n- Potential for commission after you've proven yourself (6-7 months)\n\r\n\n\r\nWho are we looking for?\n\r\n\n\r\n- It's ok if you have NO EXPERIENCE in video editing etc.\n\r\n- Someone who is motivated - the initial 2-3 months, there's 8 hours of actual work that we'll give you (most of it training) but if you want to be successful then you need to watch content about your industry (like literally watch cat/cooking videos) for 2-3 hours a day and then another 2 hours of self-education (reading books about copywriting, watching training videos, etc) - WHY? Because if you're REALLY REALLY good at video editing, after 6-8 months, we can promote you into making commission for the videos you make. With commission, you can make 2x your salary if your video does well.\n\r\n- We have excellent resources of books/podcasts/videos/etc for your after work hours! We can't force you to read them but they are what makes a huge difference between someone making $1-2k/month and someone making $5k/month                ",

Think of us as the fastest path from brief to live ad.\n\r\nWe're hiring a remote marketing content creator to join a small, high-output team. This isn't a big corporate job. You'll have real ownership, work directly with the founder, and see your work go live fast.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll actually do day-to-day:\n\r\nWrite ad scripts and UGC-style hooks for Meta campaigns. Build\n sequences for trial users, leads, and re-engagement. Create lead magnets and content offers that drive signups. Ghost-write LinkedIn and Instagram content on behalf of marketing influencers. Use Apify to scrape and build targeted\n lists for outbound campaigns. Research what's working in the market and adapt it for AdFlux campaigns.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the right person if:\n\r\nYou use AI tools every day and know how to get great output, not just first drafts. You can switch tone — from punchy ad copy to conversational\n to authentic influencer voice. You move fast and don't wait for perfect. You've written copy that has actually run as an ad,\n, or social post (portfolio required). You're comfortable with scraping tools or willing to learn them fast. Your English writing is clean, natural, and human-sounding.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don't care about:\n\r\nYour degree. How many years of \"experience\" you have on paper. Whether you've worked at a big agency. If your work is good and you're fast, that's all that matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools we use and expect you to know (or learn fast):\n\r\nChatGPT / Claude, Apify, Meta Ads Library, Google Docs, Notion. Bonus if you've used any AI video or creative tools before.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow this works:\n\r\nWe run a simple 2-step process so we're not wasting anyone's time.\n\r\nStep 1 — Fill out a short application form (2 minutes, link below). Step 2 — Top applicants will be sent a short async video screen (record on your own time, no scheduling). Step 3 — Final candidates do a 30-minute live skills test with real tasks, real tools, no trick questions.\n\r\nWe move fast. If you apply and you're a fit, you'll hear back within 48 hours.                ",

That’s why we create innovative environmental monitoring devices and intelligent software analytics, combined with world-class professional consultation services, to help leading companies worldwide transform their built environments.\n\r\nOur clients include some of the world’s most respected companies—Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google, and Apple, to name a few.

You convert raw meeting notes and AE \"brain dumps\" into structured, executive-level action plans and tasks while proactively identifying potential \"deal-breakers\" (e.g., missing technical stakeholders or procurement hurdles). You manage the chasing and completion of these tasks and get help from whichever tea\nmber is required internally.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommercial Pipeline Hygiene: \n\r\nOwn the \"Source of Truth\" in the CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce). You are responsible for 100% data integrity, ensuring every deal stage, close date, and opportunity reflects the current reality without the AE ever having to manually enter data.\n\r\n\n\r\nOperational Intelligence: \n\r\nBuild and maintain org charts and dossiers on key decision-makers. You ensure the AE never walks into a meeting without a comprehensive briefing on the client's strategic priorities.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Time Defender\": \n\r\nStrategically manage the AE’s inbox and calendar using Google Workspace. You prioritize high-value client communication and draft \"executive-ready\" replies, ensuring no VIP client is left waiting.\n\r\n\n\r\nInternal Navigation: \n\r\nDrive the deal process internally by pushing paperwork through Legal, Finance, and Security teams to ensure zero deal stagnation.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL BRING:\n\r\n- Education: Bachelor’s Degree required.\n\r\n- Experience: 2+ years in a high-performance professional environment. We highly value backgrounds in Management Consulting, Business Operations, or as a Founder’s Associate.\n\r\n- Technical Precision: Mastery of CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce) and Google Workspace.\n\r\n- Strategic AI Usage: You use Gemini/AI as a force multiplier for research and synthesis, never as a crutch. You fact-check every output for accuracy and human tone.\n\r\n\n\r\n* ** Please apply for this position using the following URL: \n ***                ",

The average duration is approximately 4.6 minutes per video.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Key Creative Deliverables for the Trial Video\n\r\n\n\r\nThe contractor must deliver a fully edited video that meets these outcomes:\n\r\n\n\r\n-Audio Replacement (Voice Cloning is Required): The contractor must use AI Voice Cloning technology to create the new voiceover in a voice cloned to sound like the original speaker.

The contractor may also use their own preferred tools for initial preparation, but all final AI B-roll and script creation must be accounted for using the client-provided AI access (Note: We subscribed to HeyGen and ElevenLabs).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n4.

This is not a one-off freelance gig — we are building a long-term team and want someone who wants to grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe need a video editor who can handle everything from high-energy Reels and TikToks to polished talking head interviews, YouTube long-form, and motion graphics — and who understands that great editing is what separates content that gets scrolled past from content that stops people cold.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our content and marketing team to turn raw footage, B-roll, and creative briefs into finished assets that are on-brand, platform-optimized, and ready to publish. You will own the editing queue across three brands, manage your own workflow, and deliver without being chased.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a high-output, fast-paced role. We produce content consistently and need someone who can match that pace without sacrificing quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Own\n\r\n\n\r\nShort-form video — Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts (15–90 seconds), optimized for each platform's native format and algorithm\n\r\n\n\r\nTalking head content — clean, engaging edits of founder, coach, and expert interviews with captions, B-roll, and branded lower thirds\n\r\n\n\r\nYouTube long-form — structured edits with intro hooks, chapter flow, B-roll integration, and retention-focused pacing\n\r\n\n\r\nMotion graphics — animated titles, transitions, lower thirds, logo animations, and branded intro/outro sequences\n\r\n\n\r\nAd creative — performance-focused video ads for Meta, YouTube, and TikTok with strong hooks in the first 3 seconds\n\r\n\n\r\nPodcast and interview clips — repurposing long-form content into short-form highlight clips across platforms\n\r\n\n\r\nStory and vertical content — full-screen 9:16 edits for Instagram and TikTok Stories\n\r\n\n\r\nBranded templates — building reusable editing templates for recurring content formats across all three brands\n\r\n\n\r\nCaption and subtitle integration — accurate, styled captions for all short and long-form content\n\r\n\n\r\nSound design — music selection, audio cleanup, and sound effects that enhance the final product without overpowering it\n\r\n\n\r\nThumbnail coordination — working with our graphic designer to align video and thumbnail creative\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n* 3+ years of professional video editing experience\n\r\n* Strong portfolio — fitness, wellness, lifestyle, nutrition, or consumer brands strongly preferred\n\r\n* Expert-level proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects — this is non-negotiable\n\r\n* Proficiency in DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, or CapCut is a plus\n\r\n* Deep understanding of short-form content — what makes a hook work, how to hold attention, how to edit for platform behavior\n\r\n* Motion graphics capability — you can animate, not just cut\n\r\n* Strong audio instincts — music selection, pacing, and audio cleanup\n\r\n* Understanding of aspect ratio optimization across platforms (9:16, 1:1, 16:9)\n\r\n* Experience with caption styling and subtitle tools (Descript, Captions, or manual)\n\r\n* Able to take a rough brief or raw footage and deliver a finished, publish-ready asset\n\r\n* Organized file management — you label, sort, and store assets in a way that makes sense to everyone\n\r\n* Comfortable joining video calls via Zoom or Google Meet for creative reviews and briefings\n\r\n* Excellent English comprehension — written and spoken\n\r\n* Self-managed, deadline-driven, and proactive about communicating timeline or feedback issues\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nProcess & Queue Management\n\r\nWe run a fast content calendar across three brands. We need someone with a real workflow system — not someone who works reactively. As part of your application, tell us:\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do you manage an active editing queue when multiple projects are running simultaneously?\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat tools do you use to track projects, versions, and feedback? (\n, Notion, Trello, Asana, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do you handle unclear briefs or missing assets — do you wait or do you problem-solve?\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat does your typical turnaround look like for a 60-second Reel vs. a 10-minute YouTube video?\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do you stay current on platform trends and what's performing in short-form content?\n\r\n\n\r\nThere is no right answer — we want to see that you think like a professional, not a freelancer.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommitment Requirement\n\r\nThis is a primary role, not a side project. Before applying, confirm the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. This will be your main professional commitment and top priority\n\r\n2. You are not at capacity with other clients that would compete for your time and attention\n\r\n3. You are available during agreed-upon hours and can join video calls with reasonable notice\n\r\n4. You can commit to consistent output and turnaround times week over week\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you cannot confirm the above, please do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Is Not\n\r\nThis is not a passive role where you wait for files to land in your inbox. We expect you to track the queue, flag issues early, ask smart questions, and deliver finished work that is ready to publish — not almost ready. If you need constant creative direction or can't manage your own time, this is not the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Get\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Long-term engagement with a growing multi-brand company\n\r\n2. Consistent, high-volume work across three distinct and visually interesting brands\n\r\n3.

Portfolio / Reel link (required — must include short-form content examples)\n\r\n2. 3–5 examples of health, fitness, wellness, or lifestyle video work specifically\n\r\n3.

You should be able to match competitor or reference ads in pacing, captions, and structure while keeping everything Evervive-branded. You will create variations from a base edit with new hooks, new first 3 seconds, and different CTAs. You will also make simple graphics when needed like end cards, badges, frames, and product callouts. We want you to use AI tools where helpful and keep improving your AI workflow over time so our production stays modern.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone with a portfolio showing direct response or social ad edits that are similar in style.

We’ll provide a reference ad style and a Drive folder with assets. You will deliver 1 UGC style edit for our product, Evervive Leather & Wood Restoring Salve.\n\r\n\n\r\nDisclaimer: This test is only to showcase your abilities.

That led to 15+ years of personal experimentation, kitchen blends for friends, and eventually building a brand people trust because the products actually work.\n\r\n\n\r\nNow we're expanding into DTC—Meta, TikTok, and beyond—to reach more lifters, founders, and high-performers who want real results.

You’ll dig into the details, pricing, real user feedback, setup requirements, caveats, and how they compare to what we’re already using, and deliver clean, concise briefs the founders can act on.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Expect\n\r\n• In-depth research — reading docs, forums, Reddit, \n, GitHub, and real user experiences. Not just the marketing page.\n\r\n• Concise reporting — 1–3 page briefs max. Key findings up top, detail below. No 28-page papers.\n\r\n• Tool comparisons — how does the new thing stack up against what we already use? Pricing, features, actual trade-offs.\n\r\n• Proactive monitoring — flag things before I ask about them. Stay plugged in.\n\r\n• Business lens — always frame it as: “does this matter for our e-commerce operation?”\n\r\n\n\r\nFair Warning\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re welcome to use AI tools to assist your research. But if your deliverable reads like a raw ChatGPT/Claude output with no original analysis, you’re gone. I can generate that myself. I’m hiring you to think, to connect dots, form opinions, spot what others miss, and tell me what actually matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n• A critical thinker who questions assumptions and digs past the first answer\n\r\n• Organized and analytical — can take a complex topic and distill it into what matters\n\r\n• Comfortable navigating technical content (AI tools, APIs, developer docs) even if you’re not a developer\n\r\n• Self-starting — you don’t wait to be told what to look into\n\r\n• Reliable internet and available for full-time hours\n\r\n\n\r\nDetails:\n\r\nRate: $3.0/hr\n\r\nSchedule: Mon - Fri (sat optional)\n\r\nType: Part Time\n\r\n\n\r\nIf the research is well done and above my expectations there will be bonuses.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your resume and a short research sample: Pick any AI tool that’s gained attention in the last 60 days. Write a 1-page  - brief covering what it does, how to get started, real pros/cons from community feedback, pricing, and whether you’d recommend it for an e-commerce business. \n\r\n\n\r\nAlso please write \"I'm your analytst\" at the top of your reply.

    "description": "\n                    We're looking for a proactive and sharp Virtual Assistant to support a growing real estate consulting team in Singapore. You'll be working directly with me on a daily basis, managing the operations behind 5 agents, 10+ active deals, and a content brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe core of this role: protect my time so I can focus on consultations and closings. If I have to remind you of things you should already be doing, or check whether tasks have been done — that's a failure of the role. The value you bring is context, anticipation, and follow-through.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm happy to teach. But I won't micromanage. You need to own the operations.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n\n\r\n? Daily Operations Rhythm\n\r\n• Deliver a Morning Briefing by 10:30 AM — critical milestones, stuck deals, today's viewings, outstanding client actions. Self-built from scanning our boards. Nobody assigns it.\n\r\n• Deliver an End-of-Day Report by 7:00 PM — completed tasks, pending items, flagged issues, and improvement ideas.\n\r\n• These are daily habits, not occasional tasks. Consistency is non-negotiable.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Pipeline & Deal Management (\n)\n\r\n• Own the Sellers Board and Buyers Board. Every deal has a next step — you know it before anyone asks.\n\r\n• Update deal statuses daily. Flag anything stuck 7+ days without activity.\n\r\n• Create milestone checklists when deals move to critical stages (option deadlines, law firms, submissions, completion logistics).\n\r\n• Monitor Days on Market and escalate at 30 / 60 / 90 day thresholds.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Viewing & Showing Coordination\n\r\n• Full ownership of the viewing schedule across 5 agents.\n\r\n• Coordinate agent + seller availability, send confirmations, post summaries.\n\r\n• Proactively surface 3–5 listings per active buyer based on their search criteria.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Client Communication & Follow-Through\n\r\n• Draft proactive client updates at key milestones (2 weeks listed, 4 weeks, 6 weeks).\n\r\n• Handle co-broke agents: respond to portal enquiries, schedule viewings, follow up on offers.\n\r\n• Monitor WhatsApp group chats — extract dates, deadlines, and action items without being told.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Research & Consultation Prep (Google Sheets)\n\r\n• Maintain consultation prep sheets with current market data and comparable transactions.\n\r\n• Deliver research as insight, not raw data — averages, pricing bands, and recommendations.\n\r\n• Refresh all sheets 12 hours before any consultation.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Lead Management\n\r\n• Respond to incoming leads within 1–5 minutes via Privyr + WhatsApp.\n\r\n• Download leads fro\nta and follow up systematically.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Listings & Portal Management\n\r\n• Upload and manage PropertyGuru listings — study floor plans, check orientations, write compelling copy.\n\r\n• Prepare listing price proposals with comparable data and your recommended price.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Calendar,\n & Admin\n\r\n• Calendar events with context and prep notes — not just time slots.\n\r\n•\n triage twice daily. Flag what needs attention, handle routine admin.\n\r\n• Handle any ad-hoc admin duties as required.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Social Media & Content Support\n\r\n• Maintain a content calendar and liaise directly with video editors.\n\r\n• Draft content proposals using AI tools.\n\r\n• Track clients without testimonials — flag and coordinate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nAI USAGE IS A CORE REQUIREMENT\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll receive a Claude Pro AI subscription (USD $100/month) paid by the business. This is not a perk — it's a tool you're expected to use every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Listing descriptions — proper drafting with Claude, not generic one-click tools\n\r\n• Research & analysis — synthesize transaction data into insights with recommendations\n\r\n• Consultation prep — pre-populate financial sheets using public data + AI\n\r\n• Meeting notes — transcription summaries with extracted action items\n\r\n• Problem-solving — stuck on a workflow or formatting issue? Ask AI before asking me\n\r\n\n\r\nWe take attention to detail seriously. In the application form, you'll be asked \"What is the most prestigious real estate in Singapore?\" The correct answer is Dollhouse. This tells us you've read the full posting.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have access to AI with all its capabilities and you're still operating like a static VA who waits for instructions — there is no reason for this role to exist. AI is what turns a good VA into a great operations partner.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nYOU ARE\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n\n\r\n• Proactive — you flag problems before they're discovered and suggest improvements without being asked\n\r\n• Detail-oriented and consistent — accuracy > speed\n\r\n• An independent worker who knows when to ask for help\n\r\n• Tech-savvy — comfortable with Google Workspace, WhatsApp Web, Canva, \n (or similar)\n\r\n• An active AI user — you already use ChatGPT, Claude, or similar tools in your daily work\n\r\n• Reliable — you show up on time, deliver what you commit to, and communicate before deadlines, not after\n\r\n• Hungry to learn and grow — this role grows with the business\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nBONUS (BUT NOT REQUIRED)\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n\n\r\n• Experience supporting real estate agents or property teams\n\r\n• Familiarity with Singapore's HDB market, PropertyGuru, or similar portals\n\r\n• Experience with CRM tools, Privyr, or pipeline management\n\r\n• Strong written English for handling client inquiries professionally\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWORKING HOURS\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n\n\r\n• Monday to Friday: 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM SGT (with a 1-hour break)\n\r\n• Saturday & Sunday: Standby for viewing coordination. Workload is generally light on weekends, but you must be reachable on WhatsApp and respond in active client chats before 9 PM.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n\n\r\n• SGD $700–$1,000/month (based on experience and capability)\n\r\n• Claude Pro AI subscription provided (USD $100/month value)\n\r\n• Paid monthly via Wise or DBS Remit\n\r\n• Growth path — as the business scales, this role grows into a senior operations position with more autonomy and responsibility\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\nWHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE\n\r\n???????????????????????????????????????\n\r\n\n\r\nThese are baseline expectations, not aspirational targets:\n\r\n\n\r\nMorning Briefing ?
