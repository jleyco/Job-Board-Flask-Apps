We have 2 primary brands in our portfolio: \n\r\n(1) an international award-winning coffee products brand \n / \n).\n\r\n(2) an educational coaching program that helps entrepreneurs grow their businesses to create a positive impact in the world!\n\r\n\n\r\nOur two recent flagship products became the world’s most successful launches in their categories. We’ve shipped more than 200,000 orders worldwide and we’re continuing to expand.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur culture is transparent and candid. You’re always welcome (and encouraged!) to ask questions or express a difference of opinion. Learning and growth is a cornerstone of our culture, both personally and professionally.

Do you get satisfaction from making systems work better and “getting things done”? If yes, we want you on our team!\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re probably the type of person who:\n\r\n• Enjoys supporting others and finding solutions to problems\n\r\n• Has strong communication and organizational skills\n\r\n• Likes working behind the scenes to make sure everything runs like clockwork\n\r\n• Is excited to wear multiple hats and be part of a growing, fast-moving company\n\r\n• Has worked directly with founders or in a startup, and enjoys that fast-paced, flexible vibe\n\r\nWe’re not just looking for someone who can support our team, we’re looking for someone to be proactive with taking ownership of tasks, solve problems independently, and grow into larger responsibilities over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR OPPORTUNITY AND ROLE ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nOur culture is collaborative, friendly, and open. We hire people who are smart, ambitious, and have a strong desire to learn and grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nSound like you? This is an exciting long-term opportunity!\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a fully remote position. You’ll work directly with our founders and collaborate with our small but mighty team to support customer happiness, streamline operations, and take on projects that help the business grow. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a foundational role — one where you’ll gain visibility into all parts of the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you grow, your role will grow with you, based on your interests and strengths:\n\r\n• Want to work improving our systems and processes? Awesome!\n\r\n• Have ideas on how to improve our website? Fantastic!\n\r\n• Want to learn how to manage projects? Let’s go!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not just hiring for a role — we’re hiring for potential. \n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibilities will span 4 key areas: customer experience (30-40%), operations/logistics (20-30%), executive support (10-20%), and special projects (10-20%) — giving you exposure across the business. These percentages are estimates and you can expect your day-to-day to shift and evolve as the business grows and as you take ownership. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Customer Experience\n\r\n• Provide\n/chat-based support for our customers across our channels (Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale)\n\r\n• Answer order and product questions, resolve issues promptly, and ensure customers feel heard and supported\n\r\n• Support wholesale partners with order updates, invoicing, and coordination\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

Special Projects & Company Operations\n\r\n• Conduct research projects to support decision-making (tools, systems, competitors)\n\r\n• Support lead generation efforts through identifying new wholesale prospects, brand partners, or influencers\n\r\n• Support planning and execution of events, expos, or marketing campaigns — manage timelines, logistics, and tasks\n\r\n• Document and maintain SOPs for operational clarity and training\n\r\n• Test and troubleshoot web pages, workflows, or customer journeys to ensure quality and functionality\n\r\n• Take ownership of ad hoc “figure it out” tasks — we’ll guide you, but we value initiative and independent problem-solving mindset\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be trained on all platforms and tools, and we’ll support your learning — but we’re looking for someone who’s excited to take initiative and build systems along the way. This role evolves — as you grow, so will your responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / REQUIRED SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE:\n\r\nWe value curiosity, reliability, and the ability to take ownership. If you enjoy figuring things out, learning on the job, and taking initiative, you’ll thrive here. This role is not a fit if you need constant direction or struggle to manage your own time.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have experience:\n\r\n• 2+ years of experience in a customer service or operations support role \n/chat-based)\n\r\n• 1+ years experience in eCommerce environments (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)\n\r\n• Fluent in written and spoken English\n\r\n\n\r\nKey traits:\n\r\n• Strong detail orientation, organizational, and time-management skills — you’re detail-obsessed and on top of things\n\r\n• Proactive problem-solver — you take initiative, do the research, and follow through\n\r\n• Able to work independently, ask questions when needed, and communicate clearly\n\r\n• Comfortable with constructive feedback and direct, respectful communication\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional but a big plus:\n\r\n• Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus\n\r\n• Experience with executive assistant work \n/calendar/travel management)\n\r\n• Experience improving or documenting processes (SOPs)\n\r\n• Experience at a startup or small business where you wore multiple hats\n\r\n• “Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY, WORKING HOURS, HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nIf this description seems like it’s too intimidating for you, this position is probably not for you. However, if you’re still here reading and this sounds exciting for you, we’d love to meet you!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe full time monthly salary will be $\nbased on your skills and level of relevant experience. Being a member of our team has other benefits including up to 16 days of paid time off per year.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our interview process extremely quick and efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1. Get started with a quick Initial Screening here for us to get to know you: \n\r\n2.

    "description": "\n                    We are a fast-scaling DTC skincare brand on a mission to dominate the space. We don't just need a \"video editor\"; we need a Creative Catalyst who understands that an editor is the single most important person for a content engine.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are a technical wizard who thinks like a marketer, this is your chance to get in early with a brand that provides the resources for you to win.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? THE VISION\n\r\nMost brands treat editors like \"order takers.\" We don't. We believe the right editor has the biggest leverage in creating a winning ad. We are looking for a long-term partner who wants to grow with us—moving from per-batch work to a full-time role with massive bonuses, and eventually, a Creative Director or UGC Manager position.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? THE ROLE\n\r\n- Volume: 3 to 10 high-impact videos ads per week + variations for testing.\n\r\n- Direct Response Focused: You aren't just making \"pretty\" videos; you are building high-retention, cracked ads that convert.\n\r\n- The Workflow: We provide the scripts, raw B-roll, and audio to start. However, as you integrate, you will be expected to independently manage the AI workflow.\n\r\n- Sourcing: You must be able to source high-quality supplemental B-roll to fill gaps and enhance the narrative.\n\r\n- AI-Integration: You must be proficient in the modern AI stack (ElevenLabs, Veo, Kling, Runway, Sora, etc.) to enhance production value and speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR\n\r\nWe don't just prioritize \"insane editing skills\". We are looking for an editor who uses a timeline as a marketing tool.\n\r\n- Marketing DNA: You understand market awareness, consumer desires, avatars, and hooks.\n\r\n- Strategic Brain: You don't just wait for instructions; you research, brainstorm, and contribute strategy to the team.\n\r\n- Feedback Obsessed: You understand that an editor who has made a winning ad is miles apart from one who hasn't. You thrive on completing feedback loops to turn ads into winners.\n\r\n- Speed & Reliability: We are growing fast. You must be able to sustain a high-velocity editing pace without sacrificing quality.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? COMPENSATION & GROWTH\n\r\n- Trial Period: Paid per batch to ensure a perfect fit.\n\r\n- Full-Time Opportunity: We are actively looking for our \"First Hire\" anchor—if you prove your value, a competitive full-time role with a pathway to leadership + heavy bonuses is waiting.\n\r\n- Vision: We won't just pay you; we will give you the space to grow, the resources to succeed, and a pathway to leadership within the company.\n\r\n\n\r\n???? HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nDo not send a generic resume. To be considered, you must provide:\n\r\n- The Proof: A portfolio of Direct Response/E-com work (skincare or beauty preferred). *Mandatory*\n\r\n- The Marketing Mindset: Briefly explain why one of your past ads was a \"winner.\"\n\r\n- The AI Edge: Mention which AI tools you are currently using in your workflow.

Seeking a Marketing Operator to own campaigns, launches, and cross-channel execution alongside founders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ICOSA BREWHOUSE:\n\r\nICOSA Brewhouse is a globally recognized specialty coffee brand redefining how coffee is experienced. We are shaping coffee culture around the world. (\n  / \n )\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design and invent one-of-a-kind tools that didn’t exist before — tools that elevate everyday rituals and introduce new ways of enjoying coffee.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom record-breaking Kickstarter launches to collaborations with world-class coffee professionals, our products are used by champions, in top cafés, and in homes in 100+ countries around the world. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a design-led, innovation-driven brand operating in a niche we are actively shaping. We build thoughtfully, test deliberately, and care deeply about quality — in both product and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we continue to innovate, launch new products, and grow, we are looking for a Senior Social Media & Marketing Manager to take ownership of how our work is brought to life across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won’t just publish content.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help shape how new products are introduced, how campaigns are structured, and how our global community experiences our brand — while ensuring execution remains disciplined, consistent, and scalable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE AND OPPORTUNITY ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator role. Execution is central — but it is not a junior content posting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our Marketing Lead to:\n\r\n• Own day-to-day marketing delivery across core channels\n\r\n• Structure and execute campaigns from planning through rollout\n\r\n• Translate ideas into clear, executable briefs\n\r\n• Coordinate creative production across internal, outsourced, and AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n• Strengthen how our marketing engine operates over time\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will see early product prototypes.\n\r\nYou will contribute to campaign discussions before launch.\n\r\nYou will help shape how innovation is presented to a global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution is central to this role — but so is judgment, ownership, and the ability to think in campaigns rather than isolated posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own:\n\r\n\n\r\n(1) Marketing Execution Across Channels\n\r\n• Own social media execution (Instagram and\n).\n\r\n• Plan and manage content calendars aligned with brand positioning.\n\r\n• Ensure consistent publishing and follow-through across platforms.\n\r\n• Manage inbox and community engagement, including partnership or influencer communication if required.\n\r\n• Execute\n campaigns aligned with launches, promotions, and collaborations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ensure marketing execution remains structured, timely, and dependable.\n\r\n\n\r\n(2) Campaign Rollout & Launch Execution\n\r\n• Support and execute seasonal campaigns, product launches, collaborations, and promotional initiatives.\n\r\n• Translate marketing objectives into structured creative briefs.\n\r\n• Coordinate creative asset development across designers, freelancers, and AI-supported workflows.\n\r\n• Oversee cohesive cross-channel rollout so messaging, visuals, and timing align across social,\n, and paid efforts.\n\r\n• Strengthen campaign structure and rollout processes over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in campaigns — not just content pieces.\n\r\n\n\r\n(3) Creative Briefing & Quality Control\n\r\n• Create clear, structured briefs for design and content production.\n\r\n• Maintain high standards of aesthetic consistency, messaging clarity, and brand voice integrity across both human and AI-assisted workflows.\n\r\n• Draft copy or guide AI-assisted content creation when needed, ensuring outputs remain on-brand and high quality.\n\r\n• Review creative outputs for brand alignment before escalation to the Marketing Lead.\n\r\n• Collaborate comfortably in tools such as Figma or similar platforms to support execution and alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t need to be a designer — but you should have strong creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n(4) Growth & Operational Development\n\r\n• Identify opportunities to refine workflows and strengthen how our marketing engine operates.\n\r\n• Lead or contribute to structured testing and rollout of new channels or initiatives as capacity allows.\n\r\n• Over time, take increasing ownership of campaign structuring, cross-channel coordination, partnership campaign oversight, and creative alignment across performance-driven efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you demonstrate reliability and judgment, your scope expands meaningfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like:\n\r\n• Social and\n channels operate smoothly with consistent execution and strong brand alignment.\n\r\n• Campaigns are rolled out in a coordinated, cross-channel manner without last-minute chaos.\n\r\n• Creative briefs are structured, clear, and reduce friction across collaborators.\n\r\n• Marketing execution no longer bottlenecks leadership attention.\n\r\n• Early experiments in new channels or initiatives are tested in a structured way.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, you become a trusted execution leader within the marketing team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not:\n\r\n• Not a pure content creator role.\n\r\n• Not a brand strategist role.\n\r\n• Not a paid media buyer role.\n\r\n• Not an administrative coordinator role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator position inside a growing global brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n• Understands how structured marketing campaigns come together.\n\r\n• Can translate ideas into clear execution plans.\n\r\n• Is comfortable owning delivery without hand-holding.\n\r\n• Is comfortable reviewing performance data and using insights to inform execution decisions.\n\r\n• Is strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have skills or experience:\n\r\n• 4–6+ years of experience managing marketing and/or social for a brand.\n\r\n• Experience executing structured marketing campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience within D2C or product-based brands strongly preferred.\n\r\n• Comfortable operating inside e-commerce environments.\n\r\n• Highly detail-oriented and disciplined in follow-through.\n\r\n• Strong creative judgment and ability to assess content quality and brand alignment.\n\r\n• Comfort collaborating in design tools such as Figma.\n\r\n• Comfortable working directly with founders in a small, fast-moving team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBig pluses:\n\r\n• Experience supporting product launches or crowdfunding campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience creating, implementing, and refining marketing processes or building SOPs.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating freelancers or creative collaborators.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Klaviyo or similar\n platforms.\n\r\n• Exposure to AI-assisted marketing workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US:\n\r\nAt ICOSA Brewhouse, you will:\n\r\n• Work directly with founders who are deeply involved in product design, positioning, and global campaigns.\n\r\n• Operate close to innovation — seeing products and launches before they are introduced to the world.\n\r\n• Contribute to campaigns that reach a global coffee audience.\n\r\n• Have real ownership inside a small, high-performing team where your work is visible and impactful.\n\r\n• Help shape coffee culture around the world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fully remote team — but we operate with structure and discipline.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be joining a close-knit group focused on building something meaningful with collaboration and accountability. There is no office politics. No unnecessary hierarchy. Just people committed to high standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care deeply about growth — not just as a company, but as individuals. As we expand, there are real opportunities to take on broader ownership, lead initiatives, and shape how our marketing evolves.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a role where:\n\r\n• Your ideas are heard.\n\r\n• Your execution matters.\n\r\n• Your scope can grow with your capability.\n\r\nYou will feel at home here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND WORKING STRUCTURE\n\r\nFull time: 40 hours/week \n\r\nCompensation range: $1,100-$1,800 (based on relevant experience and demonstrated capability)\n\r\nUp to 16 days of paid time off annually\n\r\nAsia time zone working hours required\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nAre you ready? \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’d like to join us on our journey and grow together with us, we’re looking forward to meeting you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our application process extremely efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\n                    Innovative global coffee brand inventing one-of-a-kind tools redefining how coffee is experienced. Seeking a Marketing Operator to own campaigns, launches, and cross-channel execution alongside founders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT ICOSA BREWHOUSE:\n\r\nICOSA Brewhouse is a globally recognized specialty coffee brand redefining how coffee is experienced. We are shaping coffee culture around the world. (\n  / \n )\n\r\n\n\r\nWe design and invent one-of-a-kind tools that didn’t exist before — tools that elevate everyday rituals and introduce new ways of enjoying coffee.\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom record-breaking Kickstarter launches to collaborations with world-class coffee professionals, our products are used by champions, in top cafés, and in homes in 100+ countries around the world. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a design-led, innovation-driven brand operating in a niche we are actively shaping. We build thoughtfully, test deliberately, and care deeply about quality — in both product and execution.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs we continue to innovate, launch new products, and grow, we are looking for a Senior Social Media & Marketing Manager to take ownership of how our work is brought to life across channels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou won’t just publish content.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll help shape how new products are introduced, how campaigns are structured, and how our global community experiences our brand — while ensuring execution remains disciplined, consistent, and scalable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE AND OPPORTUNITY ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator role. Execution is central — but it is not a junior content posting role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work directly with our Marketing Lead to:\n\r\n• Own day-to-day marketing delivery across core channels\n\r\n• Structure and execute campaigns from planning through rollout\n\r\n• Translate ideas into clear, executable briefs\n\r\n• Coordinate creative production across internal, outsourced, and AI-assisted workflows\n\r\n• Strengthen how our marketing engine operates over time\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will see early product prototypes.\n\r\nYou will contribute to campaign discussions before launch.\n\r\nYou will help shape how innovation is presented to a global audience.\n\r\n\n\r\nExecution is central to this role — but so is judgment, ownership, and the ability to think in campaigns rather than isolated posts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll own:\n\r\n\n\r\n(1) Marketing Execution Across Channels\n\r\n• Own social media execution (Instagram and\n).\n\r\n• Plan and manage content calendars aligned with brand positioning.\n\r\n• Ensure consistent publishing and follow-through across platforms.\n\r\n• Manage inbox and community engagement, including partnership or influencer communication if required.\n\r\n• Execute\n campaigns aligned with launches, promotions, and collaborations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou ensure marketing execution remains structured, timely, and dependable.\n\r\n\n\r\n(2) Campaign Rollout & Launch Execution\n\r\n• Support and execute seasonal campaigns, product launches, collaborations, and promotional initiatives.\n\r\n• Translate marketing objectives into structured creative briefs.\n\r\n• Coordinate creative asset development across designers, freelancers, and AI-supported workflows.\n\r\n• Oversee cohesive cross-channel rollout so messaging, visuals, and timing align across social,\n, and paid efforts.\n\r\n• Strengthen campaign structure and rollout processes over time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think in campaigns — not just content pieces.\n\r\n\n\r\n(3) Creative Briefing & Quality Control\n\r\n• Create clear, structured briefs for design and content production.\n\r\n• Maintain high standards of aesthetic consistency, messaging clarity, and brand voice integrity across both human and AI-assisted workflows.\n\r\n• Draft copy or guide AI-assisted content creation when needed, ensuring outputs remain on-brand and high quality.\n\r\n• Review creative outputs for brand alignment before escalation to the Marketing Lead.\n\r\n• Collaborate comfortably in tools such as Figma or similar platforms to support execution and alignment.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don’t need to be a designer — but you should have strong creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n(4) Growth & Operational Development\n\r\n• Identify opportunities to refine workflows and strengthen how our marketing engine operates.\n\r\n• Lead or contribute to structured testing and rollout of new channels or initiatives as capacity allows.\n\r\n• Over time, take increasing ownership of campaign structuring, cross-channel coordination, partnership campaign oversight, and creative alignment across performance-driven efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you demonstrate reliability and judgment, your scope expands meaningfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like:\n\r\n• Social and\n channels operate smoothly with consistent execution and strong brand alignment.\n\r\n• Campaigns are rolled out in a coordinated, cross-channel manner without last-minute chaos.\n\r\n• Creative briefs are structured, clear, and reduce friction across collaborators.\n\r\n• Marketing execution no longer bottlenecks leadership attention.\n\r\n• Early experiments in new channels or initiatives are tested in a structured way.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver time, you become a trusted execution leader within the marketing team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not:\n\r\n• Not a pure content creator role.\n\r\n• Not a brand strategist role.\n\r\n• Not a paid media buyer role.\n\r\n• Not an administrative coordinator role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a senior marketing operator position inside a growing global brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nYou are someone who:\n\r\n• Understands how structured marketing campaigns come together.\n\r\n• Can translate ideas into clear execution plans.\n\r\n• Is comfortable owning delivery without hand-holding.\n\r\n• Is comfortable reviewing performance data and using insights to inform execution decisions.\n\r\n• Is strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are strategic enough to think ahead — but practical enough to execute consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have skills or experience:\n\r\n• 4–6+ years of experience managing marketing and/or social for a brand.\n\r\n• Experience executing structured marketing campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience within D2C or product-based brands strongly preferred.\n\r\n• Comfortable operating inside e-commerce environments.\n\r\n• Highly detail-oriented and disciplined in follow-through.\n\r\n• Strong creative judgment and ability to assess content quality and brand alignment.\n\r\n• Comfort collaborating in design tools such as Figma.\n\r\n• Comfortable working directly with founders in a small, fast-moving team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBig pluses:\n\r\n• Experience supporting product launches or crowdfunding campaigns.\n\r\n• Experience creating, implementing, and refining marketing processes or building SOPs.\n\r\n• Experience coordinating freelancers or creative collaborators.\n\r\n• Familiarity with Klaviyo or similar\n platforms.\n\r\n• Exposure to AI-assisted marketing workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY JOIN US:\n\r\nAt ICOSA Brewhouse, you will:\n\r\n• Work directly with founders who are deeply involved in product design, positioning, and global campaigns.\n\r\n• Operate close to innovation — seeing products and launches before they are introduced to the world.\n\r\n• Contribute to campaigns that reach a global coffee audience.\n\r\n• Have real ownership inside a small, high-performing team where your work is visible and impactful.\n\r\n• Help shape coffee culture around the world.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a fully remote team — but we operate with structure and discipline.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be joining a close-knit group focused on building something meaningful with collaboration and accountability. There is no office politics. No unnecessary hierarchy. Just people committed to high standards.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care deeply about growth — not just as a company, but as individuals. As we expand, there are real opportunities to take on broader ownership, lead initiatives, and shape how our marketing evolves.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a role where:\n\r\n• Your ideas are heard.\n\r\n• Your execution matters.\n\r\n• Your scope can grow with your capability.\n\r\nYou will feel at home here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION AND WORKING STRUCTURE\n\r\nFull time: 40 hours/week \n\r\nCompensation range: $1,100-$1,800 (based on relevant experience and demonstrated capability)\n\r\nUp to 16 days of paid time off annually\n\r\nAsia time zone working hours required\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nAre you ready? \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you’d like to join us on our journey and grow together with us, we’re looking forward to meeting you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our application process extremely efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\n                    Instagram Growth Owner — Creator-First Distribution | Performance-First Ownership\n\r\nFull-time (40 hrs/week) · Remote · $1,200/month + Performance Bonuses\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a calorie-and-macro-tracking app that feels like taking notes. Type what you ate in plain English (like \"eggs toast coffee\") or snap a photo and let AI estimate your calories and macros. No database rabbit holes. No friction.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur landing page: \n\r\n\n\r\nWe're hiring one person to own Instagram end-to-end with a clear bar: you must be able to produce positive ROI within 10 days.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: This is not a \"brand social\" role. It's not about Meta ad spend. This role is built around a creator-first growth system and distribution multiplication across multiple accounts.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n\n\r\nYou own all Instagram operations. Here's what that means:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Creator Engine (Acquisition)\n\r\n- Source creators fast: fitness, meal prep, recipes, \"what I eat,\" weight loss, gym niches\n\r\n- Negotiate performance-based deals with minimal fixed fees and clear deliverables\n\r\n- Manage quality: scripts, hooks, filming guidelines, edits, posting requirements\n\r\n- Track outcomes via codes/links; maintain a clean pipeline in Sheets, Airtable, or Notion\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Distribution Multiplication (Scaling)\n\r\n- Take winning creator content and expand reach across owned accounts + partner pages\n\r\n- Turn one winning concept into many variations: new hooks, captions, crops, CTAs\n\r\n- Operate multiple themed accounts (recipes, meal prep, gym macros, etc.) with consistent cadence\n\r\n- Stagger posts intelligently — avoid duplication spam and build compounding account trust\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Creative Iteration (Speed)\n\r\n- Ship new creatives fast: hooks, scripts, briefs, edits, re-cuts\n\r\n- Build a \"winner playbook\" — when something hits, produce 10+ variations quickly\n\r\n- Maintain a testing cadence that's relentless, measurable, and not vibes-based\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Outbound Ops (Pipeline)\n\r\n- Run IG DM and\n outreach to creators, communities, and distribution partners\n\r\n- Build repeatable templates: outreach, follow-ups, negotiation, contracts, checklists\n\r\n- Keep your tracker/CRM clean with clear statuses and next actions\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE 2 KPIs YOU'LL OWN\n\r\n\n\r\nKPI #1: Day-10 Instagram Contribution ROI (cROI)\n\r\ncROI = Instagram-attributed revenue ÷ Instagram total spend (creator costs, editing, tools, boosting if used). Target: break-even or better (cROI ? 1.0) by Day 10, then improve and scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nKPI #2: Weekly Net-New Paying Subscribers from Instagram (NNPS-IG)\n\r\nFirst-time paying subscribers attributed to Instagram via trackable links, codes, or landing pages. Target: grow week-over-week while maintaining KPI #1.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: iOS attribution is imperfect. You're expected to build measurement that's honest, consistent, and decision-useful.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE IN YOUR FIRST 10 DAYS\n\r\n\n\r\n- A creator pipeline producing consistent deal flow with negotiated terms and scheduled posts\n\r\n- 10–20 creator videos in motion (live or scheduled) with tracking links/codes\n\r\n- A functioning distribution network: multiple accounts posting variations, not identical duplicates\n\r\n- Daily reporting loop: what shipped, what performed, what's being cut, what's being scaled\n\r\n- At least one repeatable path to cROI ? 1.0 with a plan to scale without ROI collapsing\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n\n\r\nMust Have:\n\r\n- Proven, revenue-accountable Instagram growth experience (creators + content systems + distribution)\n\r\n- Strong fundamentals: hook writing, creative direction, offer positioning, conversion instincts\n\r\n- Comfort operating under iOS attribution constraints without lying to yourself\n\r\n- Operator mindset: you ship fast, measure honestly, iterate without a big team\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points:\n\r\n- Mobile subscription growth experience (trial-to-paid, payback windows, churn/LTV thinking)\n\r\n- UGC pipeline building (sourcing + scripting + editing workflow)\n\r\n- Multi-account content distribution without destroying trust signals\n\r\n- Strong taste in short-form content — you can feel what holds attention in the first 1–2 seconds\n\r\n\n\r\nYou Do NOT Need:\n\r\n- Prior experience with a calorie/macro app specifically\n\r\n- \"Influencer marketing\" as your only skill — this is an end-to-end growth system role\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT WE OFFER\n\r\n\n\r\n- $1,200/month for ~40 hrs/week\n\r\n- Performance bonuses tied directly to ROI and subscriber growth\n\r\n- Payment via Wise (twice monthly)\n\r\n- Shape company culture and growth systems from day one\n\r\n- Collaborative Estonian team: regular syncs, high ownership, fast decisions\n\r\n- Fully remote — flexible hours with some overlap for syncs\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your application with the letter X, then answer these two questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A short note on how you'd get to positive ROI in 10 days using a creator-first distribution engine (no heavy reliance on paid ads).\n\r\n\n\r\n2. 1–2 examples of creator-led growth systems you've run. Include: what you shipped, how you tracked results, and how you scaled winners. Link to an IG account you grew or a screenshot of campaign results if you have one.                ",

We have 2 primary brands in our portfolio: \n\r\n(1) an international award-winning coffee products brand \n / \n).\n\r\n(2) an educational coaching program that helps entrepreneurs grow their businesses to create a positive impact in the world!\n\r\n\n\r\nOur two recent flagship products became the world’s most successful launches in their categories. We’ve shipped more than 200,000 orders worldwide and we’re continuing to expand.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur culture is transparent and candid. You’re always welcome (and encouraged!) to ask questions or express a difference of opinion. Learning and growth is a cornerstone of our culture, both personally and professionally. We work hard, and we have fun!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nWe’re looking for a proactive and detail-oriented team player to fill this role—someone who thrives on solving problems, staying organized, and making things run smoothly across departments.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you love helping customers, supporting a team, and keeping operations organized? Do you get satisfaction from making systems work better and “getting things done”? If yes, we want you on our team!\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re probably the type of person who:\n\r\n• Enjoys supporting others and finding solutions to problems\n\r\n• Has strong communication and organizational skills\n\r\n• Likes working behind the scenes to make sure everything runs like clockwork\n\r\n• Is excited to wear multiple hats and be part of a growing, fast-moving company\n\r\n• Has worked directly with founders or in a startup, and enjoys that fast-paced, flexible vibe\n\r\nWe’re not just looking for someone who can support our team, we’re looking for someone to be proactive with taking ownership of tasks, solve problems independently, and grow into larger responsibilities over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR OPPORTUNITY AND ROLE ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nOur culture is collaborative, friendly, and open. We hire people who are smart, ambitious, and have a strong desire to learn and grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nSound like you? This is an exciting long-term opportunity!\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a fully remote position. You’ll work directly with our founders and collaborate with our small but mighty team to support customer happiness, streamline operations, and take on projects that help the business grow. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a foundational role — one where you’ll gain visibility into all parts of the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you grow, your role will grow with you, based on your interests and strengths:\n\r\n• Want to work improving our systems and processes? Awesome!\n\r\n• Have ideas on how to improve our website? Fantastic!\n\r\n• Want to learn how to manage projects? Let’s go!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not just hiring for a role — we’re hiring for potential. \n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibilities will span 4 key areas: customer experience (30-40%), operations/logistics (20-30%), executive support (10-20%), and special projects (10-20%) — giving you exposure across the business. These percentages are estimates and you can expect your day-to-day to shift and evolve as the business grows and as you take ownership. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Customer Experience\n\r\n• Provide\n/chat-based support for our customers across our channels (Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale)\n\r\n• Answer order and product questions, resolve issues promptly, and ensure customers feel heard and supported\n\r\n• Support wholesale partners with order updates, invoicing, and coordination\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Order Management & Platform Coordination\n\r\n• Manage, monitor, and troubleshoot orders across Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale channels\n\r\n• Troubleshoot and resolve shipping or fulfillment issues with partners and customers\n\r\n• Maintain accurate product listings, inventory data, and logistics information across platforms\n\r\n\n\r\n3.

Special Projects & Company Operations\n\r\n• Conduct research projects to support decision-making (tools, systems, competitors)\n\r\n• Support lead generation efforts through identifying new wholesale prospects, brand partners, or influencers\n\r\n• Support planning and execution of events, expos, or marketing campaigns — manage timelines, logistics, and tasks\n\r\n• Document and maintain SOPs for operational clarity and training\n\r\n• Test and troubleshoot web pages, workflows, or customer journeys to ensure quality and functionality\n\r\n• Take ownership of ad hoc “figure it out” tasks — we’ll guide you, but we value initiative and independent problem-solving mindset\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be trained on all platforms and tools, and we’ll support your learning — but we’re looking for someone who’s excited to take initiative and build systems along the way. This role evolves — as you grow, so will your responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / REQUIRED SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE:\n\r\nWe value curiosity, reliability, and the ability to take ownership. If you enjoy figuring things out, learning on the job, and taking initiative, you’ll thrive here. This role is not a fit if you need constant direction or struggle to manage your own time.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have experience:\n\r\n• 2+ years of experience in a customer service or operations support role \n/chat-based)\n\r\n• 1+ years experience in eCommerce environments (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)\n\r\n• Fluent in written and spoken English\n\r\n\n\r\nKey traits:\n\r\n• Strong detail orientation, organizational, and time-management skills — you’re detail-obsessed and on top of things\n\r\n• Proactive problem-solver — you take initiative, do the research, and follow through\n\r\n• Able to work independently, ask questions when needed, and communicate clearly\n\r\n• Comfortable with constructive feedback and direct, respectful communication\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional but a big plus:\n\r\n• Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus\n\r\n• Experience with executive assistant work \n/calendar/travel management)\n\r\n• Experience improving or documenting processes (SOPs)\n\r\n• Experience at a startup or small business where you wore multiple hats\n\r\n• “Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY, WORKING HOURS, HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nIf this description seems like it’s too intimidating for you, this position is probably not for you. However, if you’re still here reading and this sounds exciting for you, we’d love to meet you!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe full time monthly salary will be $\nbased on your skills and level of relevant experience. Being a member of our team has other benefits including up to 16 days of paid time off per year.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our interview process extremely quick and efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.

You’ll help us:\n\r\n • launch a content/resource hub with 20–25 high-quality pages\n\r\n • create clean, consistent marketing + client education materials\n\r\n • speed up how we communicate with clients (clearer visuals, better pages, smoother onboarding)\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll do\n\r\n\n\r\nWebsite build-outs (core focus)\n\r\n • Build and refresh 20–25 website pages to kickstart a content/resource hub (feature launches, SOP-style guides, education pages)\n\r\n • Work mainly in Wix Studio (if you’re strong in WordPress/CMS and can ramp fast, that’s totally acceptable)\n\r\n • Turn rough wireframes/notes into polished pages with strong layout, hierarchy, and readability\n\r\n • Make smart design decisions independently (no “waiting for the founder to approve every pixel” energy)\n\r\n\n\r\nMarketing + client-education assets\n\r\n • Create branded assets in Canva (LinkedIn carousel/swipe posts, onboarding visuals, lightweight collateral)\n\r\n • Maintain brand consistency using our brand kit (fonts, colours, spacing, tone)\n\r\n • Produce Figma mockups when needed (page concepts, component ideas, layout explorations) and translate them into live pages\n\r\n\n\r\nLight ops + communication support (small but helpful)\n\r\n • Support basic operations:\n triage, draft/reply to simple messages, flag priority items\n\r\n • Gradually step into client onboarding/follow-ups once you understand the business (you may be looped into onboarding comms or occasional calls)\n\r\n\n\r\nHow we collaborate\n\r\n • Daily comms:\n\r\n • Files/docs: Google Workspace\n\r\n • Documentation: Confluence (easy to learn)\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-have qualifications (self-check)\n\r\n • Formal design education (degree, diploma, or recognised certification) — not purely self-taught\n\r\n • Strong portfolio showing web + marketing design (live links and/or case studies)\n\r\n • Confident in Canva (independent creation of marketing assets)\n\r\n • Confident in Figma (UI/UX mockups, layouts, components)\n\r\n • Web platform capability: Wix Studio preferred, or strong WordPress/CMS experience and can ramp quickly\n\r\n • Professional, client-ready English (written + spoken)\n\r\n • Comfortable working with autonomy and initiative (minimal hand-holding)\n\r\n • Secure home office + reliable internet\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have (but not required)\n\r\n • Wix Studio experience specifically (responsive rules, components, Studio builder)\n\r\n • Experience designing education/resource hubs, knowledge bases, or feature launch pages\n\r\n • Basic copywriting / UX writing instincts\n\r\n • Confluence familiarity or experience documenting workflows\n\r\n • Comfortable using AI tools to speed up drafts (with good judgment)\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nSuccess outcomes (30 / 60 / 90 days)\n\r\n\n\r\n30 days — settled in + shipping\n\r\n • Learn the brand + cadence\n\r\n • Ship your first pages/assets with minimal revisions\n\r\n • Establish a weekly rhythm (plan early-week, deliver end-week)\n\r\n\n\r\n60 days — consistent output\n\r\n • Reliably produce high-quality pages and Canva assets end-to-end\n\r\n • Confidently handle simple client follow-ups/onboarding comms\n\r\n\n\r\n90 days — pipeline owner\n\r\n • Own the web + marketing design pipeline\n\r\n • Clear the initial backlog of pages\n\r\n • Reduce founder involvement to quick reviews vs constant direction\n\r\n\n\r\n?\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this role matters\n\r\n\n\r\nThe business is growing and shipping features, but design + content updates are bottlenecked by founder capacity.

    "description": "\n                    Summary\n\r\nI'm starting a new YouTube channel focused on AI, automation, and marketing. I'm looking for a talented video editor to help bring this channel to life.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What I Am Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nI need a video editor who can take raw scene clips and turn them into polished, engaging content — both as standalone Shorts and as a full-length YouTube video. You should be comfortable with motion graphics, on-screen overlays, and creating content that keeps viewers watching. I value speed, consistency, and a strong creative eye.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nEach video consists of approximately 6 short scenes (100–120 seconds each). Your workflow for every video will be:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Take each individual scene (100–120 second clips) and edit them as standalone YouTube Shorts — clean transitions, text overlays, relevant graphics, and motion elements that make each Short feel polished and engaging on its own. Some videos will have fewer scenes since not all scenes will be ‘Short-worthy,’ but I record in 120-second increments, so the full video is around 8 minutes and will have around 6 scenes.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Merge all 6 edited scenes together into one cohesive long-form YouTube video with smooth transitions between scenes, consistent branding, and professional pacing.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo every deliverable set includes around 3–6 Shorts + 1 full YouTube video\n\r\n\n\r\n## Specific Skills Needed\n\r\n\n\r\nProficient in CapCut Pro (this is required — no exceptions). Motion graphics and animated overlays including lower thirds, callouts, kinetic text, and relevant on-screen graphics. Strong sense of pacing, transitions, and visual storytelling. Experience editing YouTube content specifically, with an understanding of retention, hooks, and platform best practices. Ability to create vertical Shorts from horizontal footage with proper reframing.\n\r\n\n\r\n## To Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nGot it — here is the **fully consolidated, final version** with your software experience questions added and everything cleaned up and ready to post/apply:\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## To Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nYou **must** include your portfolio or reel in your proposal. Applications without a portfolio will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease answer the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Do you have experience with **Adobe Premiere**, **Adobe After Effects**, and **CapCut**?\n\r\n2. How many years of experience do you have with each tool?\n\r\n3. Please provide your portfolio or reel (required).\n\r\n\n\r\nAlso, share examples of YouTube videos and/or Shorts you’ve edited — especially any work that includes motion graphics or overlay work. Bonus points if you can provide before-and-after examples showing raw footage compared to the final edit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere is an opportunity for this role to become full-time. However, I’m looking to start with someone on a freelance or per-video basis. As we begin working together, there will be a high volume of videos, and for the right candidate, I’m open to transitioning into a full-time position.\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m looking forward to finding a long-term editor who can grow with the channel. If you’re fast, creative, and detail-oriented, I’d love to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\n---                ",
