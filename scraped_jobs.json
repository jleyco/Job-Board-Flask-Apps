This means using visuals, text overlays, motion graphics, B-roll and so on that helps the viewer to understand the concepts that are being shared. The goal isn't purely to create an engaging video. Visuals and editing are also there to support the education and help the viewer to understand it.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a job with high creative freedom. I am the voice of my channel and content, but you are the visual director. You are free to bring up your own ideas and d\n on what you believe to be the best way of illustrating points. \n\r\n\n\r\nOn average, my videos are around 10 to 15 minutes each, though some might be longer. And the volume I'm looking for is to put out two videos per week (8 per month).\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Thumbnails\n\r\nHelp with the graphics for YouTube would be a huge help. Packaging is everything on this platform. The perfect candidate knows what draws people's attention and makes them click. For each edited video, you would design 1 to 3 thumbnails that go along with the video. \n\r\n\n\r\n3. Short form editing\n\r\nDepending on available time, work would extend to editing for YouTube shorts as well. The editing for this is going to be faster paced editing. Edits would include captions, B-roll, graphics, overlays and so on.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Perfect Candidate:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Understands Viewer & Platform Psychology\n\r\nWhat makes someone click on a video thumbnail? How can you visually grab attention in the first few seconds? What keeps a viewer engaged throughout? How can visualize help the viewer with learning? Those are just a few things that go into into success on YouTube. The ideal candidate understands both the platform and how to keep the viewer engaged.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Has An Eye for Detail\n\r\nThis goes hand in hand with having pride in your work. There are many details that can make or break a video. You understand this and strives for excellence. And you take ownership so that even the small details are done well. You are someone who doesn't feel comfortable with delivering something that is worse than what you know you're capable of. \n\r\n\n\r\n3. Uses Clear Communication\n\r\nWe are a team with the goal of helping men through content. If you are stuck, tell me or ask for help. If you have a better idea than mine, share it. If you're running behind on schedule or need some time of, communicate it in advance. Anything is solvable, but clear communication is required for a good partnership.\n\r\n\n\r\n4.   Is Reliable\n\r\nIdeally, I'm looking for someone who can work alongside me for the long run and can grow with me as the channel grows. You are someone that I can count on. \n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nIf you've read this far, please follow these steps to apply. These questions help me in gauging how well you've read this job posting and your understanding of it. Generic messages that look like ChatGPT wrote them might be ignored. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Mention \"I am your teammate\" in your initial message. \n\r\n2. Share some examples of videos that you have edited in the past.\n\r\n3. Share a link to a long-form video (not yours) that you think best fits the style of edits that I described. Explain why you picked it. \n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to working with you!\n\r\nMaikel                ",

CTA\n\r\nInstinct for pacing and retention — you know when viewers drop off and how to prevent it\n\r\nProficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve (After Effects, CapCut, or similar as secondary tools)\n\r\nAbility to edit native-feeling content across formats and aspect ratios (9:16, 1:1, 16:9)\n\r\nStrong caption and text overlay game — clean, readable, strategically timed\n\r\nFast turnaround without sacrificing quality — you can ship a solid 30–60s ad within 24 hours\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points If You\n\r\nHave worked directly with media buyers and understand metrics like CTR, hook rate, hold rate, thumbstop ratio, and ROAS\n\r\nCan write or improve ad copy, hooks, and CTAs — not just edit what’s handed to you\n\r\nHave experience with info product launches, coaching funnels, or supplement/DTC brands\n\r\nKnow how to build urgency, stack social proof, and handle objections through editing choices\n\r\nCan create basic motion graphics, lower thirds, and kinetic typography\n\r\nHave experience with long-form VSLs (10–30+ minutes) with slide-based or hybrid formats\n\r\nUnderstand the difference between a brand ad and a direct response ad — and why that matters\n\r\n\n\r\nCreative formats you'll work on:\n\r\nUGC Ads, VSLs, Testimonial Mashups, Product Demos, Advertorials Videos etc                ",

Right now, all of our sales happen in the Netherlands. We're ready to change that, and we're looking for the person to help us do it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat this role is:\n\r\nWe're building our international sales track from the ground up, and we're looking for a driven person to lead that effort alongside Tom, our co-founder. Your focus will be on international markets, though you'll occasionally support the Dutch market too, where we use AI to help bridge language and communication gaps.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is early-stage work.

You pick up new things fast, you're curious about AI and what it can do for businesses, and you want a role where your results are visible and your responsibility grows with them.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience in sales helps, but it's not the point. The right attitude, communication skills, and willingness to figure things out matter far more.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe assess candidates through a short video introduction rather than long application forms. If this sounds interesting, send us a 3 to 7 minute video answering:\n\r\n1. A brief intro about yourself and what drives you\n\r\n2. Your experience with talking to clients, selling, or any customer-facing work\n\r\n3. What excites you about working at an AI company right now\n\r\n4.

We’re building a platform where quality, clarity, and consistency come first, so students always know they’re learning from something they can trust.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role owns content delivery end-to-end. You’ll be responsible for making sure every piece of content goes from idea to live on the platform smoothly, on time, and to a very high standard.\n\r\nYou’ll sit at the centre of multiple moving parts. Working closely with the CEO, product, editors, and external contributors, you’ll organise timelines, manage deadlines, format resources, upload content into the Lightup backend, and quality-check everything before it goes live.\n\r\nIf you love organisation, precision, and making complex workflows run like clockwork, this role is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Operations & Delivery:\n\r\n1. Own the full lifecycle of content from planning through to publication\n\r\n2. Manage timelines and deadlines across videos, quizzes, PDFs, and revision resources\n\r\n3. Coordinate filming schedules and content creation with the CEO and contributors\n\r\n4. Liaise with external creators when needed to ensure content is delivered on time\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Formatting & Uploading:\n\r\n1. Format learning resources including PowerPoints and PDFs to match Lightup standards\n\r\n2. Upload videos, quizzes, and written content into the Lightup backend\n\r\n3. Ensure all content follows the correct structure and naming conventions\n\r\n\n\r\nQuality Assurance\n\r\n1. Proofread all content for spelling, grammar, clarity, and accuracy\n\r\n2. Check that GCSE English terminology and explanations are precise and correct\n\r\n3. QA content post-upload to ensure everything works properly and displays correctly\n\r\n4. Spot errors before students ever see them\n\r\n\n\r\nOrganisation & Ownership\n\r\n1. Create and maintain clear content trackers and delivery schedules\n\r\n2. Proactively identify risks, bottlenecks, or missing pieces and resolve them early\n\r\n3. Orchestrate multiple contributors while keeping standards high\n\r\n4. Take full ownership of content delivery without needing close supervision\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We’re Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have:\n\r\n1. Experience in content management, or production management\n\r\n2. Strong experience coordinating and leading projects with multiple stakeholders\n\r\n3. Exceptional written English and proofreading ability\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\n1. Experience in education or edtech\n\r\n2. Experience working with learning platforms or CMS systems\n\r\n3. Previous operation business administration \n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\n1. Highly organised and process-driven\n\r\n2. Extremely detail-oriented with a low tolerance for errors\n\r\n3. Confident managing deadlines and holding others accountable\n\r\n4. Comfortable working autonomously with high responsibility\n\r\n5. Calm, reliable, and precise under pressure\n\r\n6. Passionate about producing high-quality educational content\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters:\n\r\nThis role is critical to Lightup’s success. You’re not just “uploading content”. You’re protecting quality, consistency, and trust. Students rely on what we publish, and you’ll be the person ensuring everything meets the standard they deserve.\n\r\nIf you love making systems work, enjoy ownership, and take pride in flawless execution, you’ll thrive here.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication: If you are interested in this role, please reach out and we will send you an internal application link for you to complete for consideration by our panel.

You'll help prevent them.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll dig deeper to understand why things break:\n\r\n— Why did this customer feel unheard?\n\r\n— Why did our rep send a template instead of showing empathy?\n\r\n— Why does our knowledge base fail customers?\n\r\n\n\r\nThen work with our CS Team Lead to solve it—shaping training, resources, and SOPs based on what you found.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour ideas will actually matter here.\n\r\n\n\r\nSo if you're someone who:\n\r\n— Prides themselves on catching details others miss\n\r\n— Wants to have real impact on customer experience\n\r\n— Thrives in fast-paced startups, not stagnant corporate environments\n\r\n— Wants to do work that matters—improving the health and wellness of families\n\r\n\n\r\nThis opportunity is for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nWe're a wellness brand helping parents navigate their children's health. These are delicate topics where a careless\n can break trust, but an empathetic response can earn it completely.\n\r\n\n\r\nUnlike most eCommerce brands that treat support as a cost center, we see it as the core of our mission. Every interaction is a chance to help a worried parent feel heard, reassured, and confident in their decision.\n\r\n\n\r\nRight now, we're at a critical point. We're scaling fast—aiming for 8 figures in our second year—and we refuse to let quality slip as we grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why we need a QA Analyst who ensures every customer interaction meets our standard—no matter how quickly we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role: What You'll Own\n\r\nAs our QA Analyst, you'll ensure every customer interaction reflects our mission of empathy, clarity, and safety.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll partner directly with our Customer Support Team Lead to maintain quality standards while we scale.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Core Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Audit Customer Interactions\n\r\n— Review support tickets to evaluate quality standards\n\r\n— Look beyond compliance: Did we actually help this customer?\n\r\n— Spot patterns in what's working and what's breaking\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Calibration & Standards\n\r\n— Align with Team Lead on what \"world-class\" customer experience looks like\n\r\n— Ensure audits are fair, consistent, and tied to actual customer outcomes\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Deliver Actionable Insights\n\r\n— Turn audit findings into clear, specific feedback for Team Lead\n\r\n— Don't just point out problems—show exactly what needs to change\n\r\n— Enable better coaching by providing data that actually helps\n\r\n— Close the feedback loop: Did the coaching work? Did the SOP update solve the problem?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Identify Trends & Recommend Fixes\n\r\n— Spot recurring customer pain points or Knowledge Base gaps\n\r\n— Recommend SOP updates that prevent issues from repeating\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\nWe're not looking for a checkbox auditor who follows a script. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe need a strategic thinker who can see the forest and the trees. [too metaphorical]\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-Have Experience:\n\r\n— 2+ years in Customer Support QA (eCommerce, wellness, or \"high-empathy\" industries preferred)\n\r\n— Proficiency with helpdesk tools like Zendesk, Gorgias, or Help Scout\n\r\n— Comfortable with project management tools like Notion, Asana, ClickUp, or Monday\n\r\n— Exceptional written communication - you're auditing communication, so you need to be great at it\n\r\n— You've improved QA processes before (not just followed someone else's playbook)\n\r\n\n\r\nMust-Have Attributes:\n\r\n— Fast Learner - Absorb product details, compliance guidelines, and brand voice quickly. Own —your workflow from day one.\n\r\n— Self-Starter - Thrive in fast-paced environments. Navigate ambiguity with ease. Identify gaps and implement solutions without needing a step-by-step manual.\n\r\n— Critical Thinker - Look beyond the surface to evaluate customer concerns objectively and ensure support remains world-class, empathetic, and mission-aligned.\n\r\n— Detail-Obsessed - Notice the small things: a missed link, a typo, a tone that feels slightly off for a worried customer.\n\r\n— Master of the Soft Skills - Understand the difference between \"technically correct\" and \"actually helpful.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation, Perks & Growth Path\n\r\nTotal Compensation: $750 - $900 USD/month\n\r\n— Base Salary: $750/month\n\r\n— Performance Bonus: Up to $150/month\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth Path: Quality & Training Lead\n\r\n— Design the full onboarding curriculum for our support team\n\r\n— Build the global quality framework as we scale\n\r\n— Train, manage, and develop a team of QA analysts\n\r\n\n\r\nProfessional Development\n\r\n— Workshops, certifications, training - we'll support what you need to level up\n\r\n\n\r\nPerks:\n\r\n— Work with a mission-driven wellness brand making a real impact on families\n\r\n— Small team = high visibility and meaningful influence\n\r\n— Help build QA systems from the ground up at a fast-growing startup\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Hiring Process:\n\r\n1. Submit Application (linked below)\n\r\n2. Loom Video Introduction\n\r\n3. Technical Assessment\n\r\n4. Interview with Customer Service Team Lead\n\r\n5. Final Interview with our CEO\n\r\n6. Reference Check\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Core Values\n\r\nWhich one speaks to you most? Include it in your application.\n\r\nMOVE FAST - Always prioritize quality, but do so with speed\n\r\nWORLD CLASS - We expect excellence & reject mediocrity\n\r\nGO ONE MORE - Win. Celebrate it. Then beat it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're building the #1 customer experience in the wellness space—and we need a QA Analyst who protects our standards and pushes them higher.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're ready to do work that actually matters with a team that cares as much as you do, hit apply.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n                ",

    "description": "\n                    I'm looking for a talented graphic designer who can take raw images and rough concepts and turn them into polished, professional visuals that actually sell. I work with physical products that need to look stunning online—and I need someone who can clean up product photos, remove backgrounds, swap colors to show different finishes, and make every image look like it came out of a professional studio. But that's just the starting point.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is about more than just photo editing. I need a designer who understands how visuals communicate, how to guide a buyer's eye, and how to make someone stop scrolling and pay attention. Whether it's a hero image on an Amazon listing, an infographic that explains a product's features at a glance, or a company catalog that makes our brand look polished and professional—I need someone who genuinely cares about the quality of the final product.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I need you to be able to do:\n\r\nExpert-level image editing in Photoshop, InDesign, Lightroom, Illustrator, or similar tools. You should be able to take a photo shot in less-than-ideal conditions and make it look studio-quality. Background removal is a core part of this role and needs to be clean and precise—no jagged edges, no obvious cutouts.\n\r\n\n\r\nProduct color variation editing—showing the same product in multiple finishes or colorways without a separate photoshoot for each one. If you know how to do this convincingly, that's a huge advantage.\n\r\n\n\r\nAmazon listing image creation—you should understand what makes a main image convert, how to build an infographic that communicates value quickly, and how to put together a full image set including hero shots, lifestyle images, feature callouts, and comparison graphics.\n\r\n\n\r\nBeyond product photography, I also need someone who handles the full range of graphic design work: catalogs and PDFs, logo design, website design assets, social media graphics, and anything else that falls under \"this needs to look great.\"\n\r\nWhat kind of person I'm looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nI want someone who has creative direction and brings their own eye to the work. If you see a better way to frame a product, a layout that communicates more clearly, or a color treatment that makes something pop—speak up. I'm not looking for someone who just executes instructions without thinking. I want a collaborator who cares about what the design is actually trying to accomplish.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should be organized, self-directed, and able to manage multiple projects at once. I'll be sending raw assets and short briefs regularly (and sometimes it may be as simple as create a great looking presentation using these words and here are a few reference images), and I need to trust that you'll deliver on time without constant follow-up. If you're going to miss a deadline or run into a problem, communicate early—that's all I ask. I will be using a tool like trello to track projects and timelines. To confirm you've read this entire post, please use the subject line \"Pickle\" when you reach out.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours and availability:\n\r\nThis is a part-time position. I need you available Monday through Friday, 1:00pm–6:00pm Spain time (Madrid, GMT+1). I'm based in Spain, so being available during these hours is important for collaboration and quick turnarounds.\n\r\n\n\r\nPay and schedule:\n\r\nAll hours are tracked and calculated based on California time (GMT-8) for consistency with my other tea\nmbers. I pay twice a month via Wise—on the 1st and 16th. The payment on the 16th covers work from the 1st–15th, and the payment on the 1st covers the 16th through the end of the month.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply:\n\r\n me directly at \n do not apply through the OnlineJobs.ph messaging system as I do not monitor those messages. If you have worked for a company like Design Pickle, that will be a huge bonus, as you are used to working with various projects at the same time.\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude your portfolio or work samples—before/after product photo edits are especially valuable. I want to see background removal work, color variation edits, Amazon listing images, and any other design work you're proud of.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs part of the process, I'll send you a test project using a real product image or brief. This is unpaid, but it's the only way for me to evaluate your skills and make sure we're a good fit before committing to work together. If that goes well, I will likely ask you to do a paid test so I can further evaluate your skill.\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to finding someone who can make every product and every brand asset look as good as it deserves to.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease note: You must be based in the Philippines. If you are based elsewhere—India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, or anywhere outside the Philippines—please do not apply.                ",
