I am hiring a long-term virtual assistant to publish new stencil content every week, improve SEO (especially thin-content issues), and help grow traffic and revenue. We provide a custom AI tool that can generate stencil images, so you will be using our tool as part of the workflow. The weekly output target is 3 new uploads per week, and each upload should contain 3 to 8 stencil images (a stencil set). The stencil sets must match current trends such as upcoming holidays, seasonal topics, and what people are searching for (Google search trends). You will publish each stencil set in WordPress by uploading the images, ensuring proper file naming and alt text, placing the content in the correct categories/tags, and adding internal links to relevant pages on the site.\n\r\n\n\r\nPinterest is also required: you will upload the images to our Pinterest account by creating Pins for each new stencil set (and sometimes individual stencils if appropriate), writing keyword-focused Pin titles and descriptions, linking back to the correct page on our website, and saving Pins to the right boards consistently.\n\r\n\n\r\nA major focus for this role is improving thin pages. Many pages in this niche can become “thin” if they only contain an image and little text. You must learn how to improve page quality by adding helpful text, usage ideas, simple instructions, FAQs, better formatting, and stronger internal linking so each page provides real value beyond the download. We are looking for Google SEO knowledge and experience to help improve the site performance. Experience with WordPress posting, on-page SEO, image optimization/compression, and Pinterest posting is important. Familiarity with SEO plugins and Google Search Console is a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nBonuses: Bonuses will be provided for improvements in website revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply: Please send your WordPress and SEO experience, any Pinterest work examples, and a short explanation of how you would improve a thin-content stencil page that is mostly images.

We will provide training on how we specifically expect the commentary and adjustments based on our own personal preferences, however you are expected to already have this type of experience working for other appraisers.\n\r\n2. Review the work of other report writers on our team, provide feedback, and help train newer report writers on our team. You are expected to act as the \"last line of defense\" of the report before it is sent to the appraiser for their final review before submission.

Ideally, you have experience managing other appraisal report writers.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are flexible with your work hours and offer Philippine daytime shift hours for your convenience. We would like to start part time but then transition to full time, so ideally you are open to working full time exclusively with us if its a mutual fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo be considered for this position, you must do the following in your application message (failure to do all of the following will result in your application being ignored):\n\r\n1. How many years have you worked for a US residential appraiser? What tasks did you perform for them?\n\r\n2. How many hours does it take you to complete one report?

    "description": "\n                    Do you have an eye for what makes people stop scrolling?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run two media brands in the combat sports space. We have over 10 years of video content — thousands of hours of training footage, match clips, coaching sessions, and behind-the-scenes \nnts — sitting in a vault waiting to be turned into viral Shorts, Reels, and TikToks.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need someone obsessive about content to come in and systematically mine that library, find the gold, organize everything, and keep our social media engines running across multiple platforms and multiple brands every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a \"post once a day and call it done\" gig. You'll be the backbone of our entire content operation — the person who makes sure our video editor always has clips to cut, our content calendar is always full, and our audience is always being fed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Two Brands You'll Be Working Across:\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand 1 — Championship-level amateur wrestling instruction with 10+ years of training footage. Think intense, high-energy, coach-to-athlete content.\n\r\n\n\r\nBrand 2 — Combat sports education and analysis. Deep library of instructional and analytical content.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Mining & Organization (This Is the Big One — ~40% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Systematically watch through our entire video libraries for both brands\n\r\n- Log every video in a master spreadsheet: title, duration, topic, key \nnts with timestamps, \"gold rating\" (1–5), and suggested clip ideas\n\r\n- Identify the \nnts that would make great Shorts — high energy technique demos, dramatic reactions, clean takedowns, quotable coaching \nnts, training montages, rivalry clips\n\r\n- Tag and categorize content: technique tutorials, match footage, training sessions, coaching/motivational, behind-the-scenes, product-specific\n\r\n- Organize raw files into a clean, labeled folder structure so our editor can find and grab what they need instantly\n\r\n- Maintain and update the content log as new footage comes in\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Scheduling & Posting (~30% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Manage content calendars across both brands and all platforms (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok,\n)\n\r\n- Upload, write captions, add hashtags, and publish all finished content on schedule\n\r\n- Write captions from templates and brand voice guides we provide (you'll get trained on each brand's tone)\n\r\n- Schedule content in advance using tools like Metricool, Later, or native platform schedulers\n\r\n- Ensure we never miss a posting day — consistency is everything\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity Engagement & Performance Tracking (~20% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Monitor and reply to comments across all platforms (we'll give you response guidelines)\n\r\n- Flag DMs and comments that need the founders' attention\n\r\n- Track basic performance metrics weekly: views, engagement rate, follower growth, saves, shares\n\r\n- Maintain a simple weekly report — what posted, what performed, what flopped, and why you think so\n\r\n- Identify trending content in our niches and flag opportunities to jump on trends\n\r\n\n\r\nResearch & Support (~10% of Your Time)\n\r\n- Research trending audio, formats, hashtags, and content styles in the wrestling and combat sports niche\n\r\n- Scout competitor accounts and flag content ideas worth adapting or responding to\n\r\n- Maintain asset libraries: thumbnails, brand templates, music/audio files, b-roll folders\n\r\n- Assist with miscellaneous tasks as needed — we're a small team and flexibility matters\n\r\n\n\r\nYou MUST Have:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong English skills (written — we communicate via chat, Loom, and shared docs)\n\r\n- Experience managing social media accounts and posting content consistently (show us the accounts you've managed)\n\r\n- Familiarity with at least one scheduling tool (Later, Buffer, Metricool, Hootsuite, or native platform schedulers)\n\r\n- Attention to detail — you'll be logging hundreds of videos and we need accuracy, not sloppiness\n\r\n- Ability to work independently with minimal supervision after training\n\r\n- A genuine eye for engaging content — you can tell the difference between a clip that will get 500 views and one that will get 50,000\n\r\n- Reliable internet and a quiet workspace with headphones (you'll be watching hours of video daily)\n\r\n- Willingness to overlap with US Central Time (CST) for at least 3–4 hours daily\n\r\n- Proficiency with Google Drive, Google Sheets, and basic file management\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points (Not Required But We'll Love You For It):\n\r\n\n\r\n- Interest in wrestling, combat sports, or martial arts (understanding the content makes you faster)\n\r\n- Experience with short-form video platforms as a creator or avid consumer (if your own TikTok For You page is full of combat sports content, tell us)\n\r\n- Basic photo/video editing skills (even just CapCut-level trimming and captioning)\n\r\n- Experience with Canva for creating thumbnails or simple graphics\n\r\n- Familiarity with YouTube analytics, Instagram Insights, or TikTok analytics dashboards\n\r\n- Experience working with content creators or media brands (not just corporate social accounts)\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat It's Like Working With Us:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Small team, fast-moving, zero bureaucracy\n\r\n- You'll work directly with the founders — not middle managers\n\r\n- We communicate async (Loom, Slack/chat) with a weekly sync call\n\r\n- We'll train you on exactly what \"gold\" content looks like — you don't need to figure it out alone\n\r\n- Clear expectations, direct feedback, and real growth opportunity\n\r\n- If you're great at this, there's room to grow into a content manager role as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply — READ THIS CAREFULLY:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe get a lot of applications. To make sure you actually read this post, do the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Start your application with the word **\"TAKEDOWN\"** so we know you read the full posting.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Watch this video: \n \n\r\n\n\r\n3. In your application, timestamp 3 specific \nnts from that video that you think would make great Shorts or Reels. For each \nnt, write 1-2 sentences explaining WHY you picked it — what makes it engaging, scroll-stopping, or shareable.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Send links to 2-3 social media accounts you've managed or contributed to. If you don't have professional examples, send your own personal accounts and tell us what content strategy you follow.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Tell us your available hours, timezone, and current workload (are you working other jobs?).\n\r\n\n\r\n**Do NOT send a generic application.** If your application doesn't start with \"TAKEDOWN\" and include timestamps, we won't read it.

    "description": "\n                    About Us\n\r\nWe're a growing marketing agency looking for confident, friendly phone callers to help us book meetings with interested prospects. These are warm leads only — people who have already shown interest in our service. No cold calling.\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nYou'll receive notifications when a new lead comes in. Your job is to call them quickly, let them know about the interest we've found for their business, and book them into a meeting. We provide the script, the talking points, and even AI-generated notes for each lead so you know exactly what to say. You just make the call and book the meeting.\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\nReceiving lead notifications via Slack on your phone\n\r\nCalling warm leads within 5–10 minutes of the notification\n\r\nFollowing a simple script to explain the opportunity\n\r\nBooking meetings using a provided Calendly link\n\r\nRecording each call for quality and accountability\n\r\n\n\r\nTime Commitment: Less than 3–5 hours per week. This is not an hours-worked role — it's a speed-to-lead role. When a notification comes in, you call fast. Between notifications, you're free. You'll be set up on Slack with mobile notifications so you can respond quickly wherever you are.\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n\n\r\nClear Western accent is required (American, British, Australian, or similar) — you will be calling US and UK-based business owners and executives. You must sound natural and professional on the phone. If you do not have a clear Western accent, please do not apply.\n\r\nConfident and friendly phone manner\n\r\nReliable phone and internet connection\n\r\nAvailable and responsive during US business hours — speed is everything in this role. If you can't call within 5–10 minutes of a notification, this isn't for you.\n\r\nSlack on your phone with notifications enabled\n\r\nQuiet environment for calls\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n\n\r\n$100/month base salary\n\r\n$100 per confirmed, shown booking (not just scheduled — the prospect must actually show up)\n\r\nOn the low end, expect 10+ bookings per month\n\r\nRealistic earnings: $1,100+/month for less than 5 hours of actual work per week\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role\n\r\n\n\r\nNo cold calling — every lead has already shown interest\n\r\nScripts and talking points provided — we tell you exactly what to say\n\r\nMinimal time commitment — it's about speed, not hours worked\n\r\nHigh pay per hour of actual work — at 10 bookings and 5 hrs/week, that's $50+/hr effective rate\n\r\nLong-term role — consistent lead flow with growing volume\n\r\nFlexible remote work\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\nSend a voice note (30–60 seconds) introducing yourself in English, along with a short message about any phone or sales experience you have. Include the word \"buckets\" so we know you've read this post.\n\r\n???? \n                ",

You must already have strong, practical knowledge from real client-facing support experience on GHL.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Provide Tier 1 & 2 support: troubleshooting workflows, triggers, tags, conversations, calendars, campaign optimization, and common user questions.\n\r\n- Onboard new clients to GHL (account setup, snapshots, basic workflows).\n\r\n- Guide non-technical clients through practical platform usage with patience and clear communication.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Skills:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven client-facing GHL support experience (onboarding AND ongoing daily support tickets) — not just personal or agency building.\n\r\n- Deep knowledge of everyday user issues: tracing messages to workflows, fixing conversation routing, tag failures, calendar sync problems, etc.\n\r\n- Excellent English communication (written & spoken).\n\r\n- Full-time availability with overlap in US time zones (Arizona/Phoenix preferred).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a 100% remote, full-time position (30+ hours/week).\n\r\nPaid via PayPal/Payoneer or similar.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nTo be considered, please apply with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Submit a short video introduction (1-2 minutes max, recorded via \n or similar free tool — unlisted YouTube link also fine). \n\r\n- In your written application please include how many months/years you have in client-facing GHL support (exclude personal or internal agency building only).\n\r\n- Approximate number of clients you have onboarded AND provided ongoing support to.\n\r\n- 2–3 specific examples of practical support issues you've resolved (e.g., \"Helped client trace an inbound message to the correct workflow using the Conversations tab\" or similar real ticket examples).\n\r\n- Your current time zone and daily availability for US overlap.\n\r\n- Attach resume/portfolio if available.\n\r\n\n\r\nSerious applicants with real GHL support experience only. Generic applications or those without the required examples will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will review applications and reach out via the platform for interviews.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you!

    "description": "\n                    The Real Estate Investment Underwriter is a core decision-maker responsible for evaluating residential properties across multiple exit strategies to determine whether a deal meets the company’s investment criteria. This role directly impacts company profitability by validating assumptions, stress-testing scenarios, and ensuring every approved deal has a clear, executable path to profit.  The Underwriter is the gatekeeper of company profitability. Every deal we do, or avoid, starts with this role. Strong underwriting protects the company from bad investments and ensures capital is deployed only where risk is understood and returns are justified.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Underwriter analyzes properties under three primary scenarios:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Off-Market / Investor Sale (Cash)\n\r\n2) On-Market / As-Is Condition\n\r\n3) On-Market / Renovate & Resell at After Repair Value (ARV)\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not theoretical — your numbers drive real capital deployment and are utilized for critical decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ideal DISC style is a High C / Mid D / Moderate S / Moderate I - someone who is obsessed with accuracy and data integrity, naturally skeptical of assumptions, strong at risk identification, comfortable slowing things down to get the numbers right, process oriented and analytical, loves numbers, and questions everything.  This person should be able to work independently and take ownership of outcomes while being able to defend their analysis/numbers if a deal does not work.  \n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nInvestment Analysis & Deal Underwriting\n\r\n- Analyze residential properties to determine as-is value, investor value (off market), and After Repair Value (ARV)\n\r\n- Run detailed financial models for multiple exit strategies\n\r\n- Validate deal viability using company investment criteria (returns, risk, timelines)\n\r\n- Stress-test assumptions (pricing, repairs, hold time, market shifts)\n\r\n- Clearly determine DEAL / NO DEAL decisions on opportunities\n\r\n\n\r\nValuation & Market Analysis\n\r\n- Pull, analyze, and interpret comparable sales (on-market and off-market)\n\r\n- Adjust comps accurately for condition, location, timing, and renovations\n\r\n- Track market trends and pricing shifts to ensure current, defensible valuations\n\r\n- Evaluate neighborhood-level risk and liquidity\n\r\n\n\r\nRehab & Cost Analysis\n\r\n- Verify repair assumptions align with resale strategy and buyer expectations\n\r\n- Apply appropriate contingency and cost buffers to protect margins\n\r\n\n\r\nProfitability & Risk Management\n\r\n- Ensure every approved deal meets required profit margins and return thresholds\n\r\n- Account for all costs: acquisition, rehab, holding, financing, selling, and overhead\n\r\n- Identify deal-breakers early to protect time, capital, and resources\n\r\n- Flag high-risk variables before commitment\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication & Decision Support\n\r\n- Present underwriting conclusions clearly to acquisitions, leadership, and partners\n\r\n- Defend valuations and assumptions with data and logic\n\r\n- Provide quick, confident feedback to support fast decision-making\n\r\n- Maintain underwriting documentation for accountability and post-deal review\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\r\n- 2–5+ years in real estate underwriting, investing, acquisitions, or valuation\n\r\n- Strong understanding of:\n\r\n     - After Repair Value (ARV) methodology\n\r\n     - Investor pricing models (70% rule, margin-based underwriting, etc.)\n\r\n     - Rehab cost estimation\n\r\n     - Holding costs and deal timelines\n\r\n- Advanced proficiency in Excel / Google Sheets (financial modeling required)\n\r\n- Deep familiarity with MLS data, comps, and market analysis\n\r\n- Ability to thoroughly underwrite deals with detailed accuracy\n\r\n- High attention to detail with strong judgment under pressure\n\r\n\n\r\nIdeal Candidate Traits\n\r\n- Profit-driven thinker – understands that numbers = real dollars at risk\n\r\n- Decisive but disciplined – confident making DEAL / NO DEAL decisions\n\r\n- Skeptical by nature – pressure-tests assumptions instead of accepting them\n\r\n- Process-oriented – consistent underwriting methodology\n\r\n- Ownership mindset – treats company capital like their own\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\nPay rate: $8-$10 per hour, based on experience, plus bonus \n\r\nSchedule: 40 hours per week (It could be more based on workload)\n\r\nTraining: Yes, training will be provided.

We're looking for data entry VA's, team leaders, managers, video editors, media buyers, and project leads.\n\r\n\n\r\nPay starts at $600 a month and increases with performance. We reward performance and timeliness. \n\r\n\n\r\nRoles currently available:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Business Center Creators:  You will be responsible for creating TikTok business centers daily for us that we run ads on. Everything is clearly defined, and simple to execute. SOPs that teach everything take 30 minutes to finish. Only real qualifying trait we're looking for is full availability during working hours to communicate with team, and attention to detail. Fast workers will be able to create 6 business centers an hour, normal workers around 4 an hour. We're looking for fast.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Form Creators: You will work with the business center creators above to populate each business center with forms (standard TikTok advertising options) following our instructions. \n\r\n\n\r\n3. Campaign Creators: You'll create campaigns inside the business centers. Gaming computer needed here because it's simple task but needs lots of tabs open. If computer is weak, that's the bottleneck. (example: on a decent computer it takes 5 minutes to do this task, on a slow computer can take 30)\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Top Up Specialists: High trust position, highest pay. You'll be trusted with our credit cards and asked to top up the ad accounts inside the business centers on a set cadence (once every 15 minutes for example). You'll also be looking at metrics to see which ones are worth topping up, and which ones are not. Attention to detail and financial responsibility very important here.  We require two of these positions per pod. Candidates with ACCOUNTING background preferred.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuick video explaining how the team will function together: \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, answer the following q's in a QUICK LOOM VIDEO. I need to see what you're like and looms are the best way of doing it. 60 second length is enough as long as you explain the q's below:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Which position are you interested in?\n\r\n2. 8 hours a day shifts, are you okay with that?\n\r\n3. Do you have a gaming PC? List the specs if yes.\n\r\n4. Do you have any prior experience running ads, being inside business centers or ads dashboards?\n\r\n5. Why are you looking for work right now?\n\r\n\n\r\nPS: After initial trial period, performance will be HEAVILY rewarded\n\r\n\n\r\nLooking forward to scaling together!                ",

We’re looking for a senior, agency-level editor who can take footage and shape it into polished, engaging edits — with strong creative judgment, clean finishing, and confidence with motion graphics.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a “churn out timelines” role — it’s for someone who understands pace, story, tone, sound, and polish, and can handle feedback like a pro.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll be doing\n\r\n\n\r\nCore editing\n\r\n\n\r\n • Edit short and long-form corporate/internal films: interviews + b-roll, event coverage, campaign content, training, recruitment, and social cutdowns.\n\r\n • Build strong narrative structure from real-world footage (sometimes minimal direction).\n\r\n • Deliver agency-level finishing:\n\r\n • tight pacing and clean transitions\n\r\n • strong music choices (when appropriate)\n\r\n • clean audio (dialogue clarity is everything)\n\r\n • subtitles/captions and simple graphics where needed\n\r\n • Create multiple versions efficiently (different durations, formats, and platforms).\n\r\n\n\r\nMotion graphics (After Effects)\n\r\n\n\r\n • Design and animate:\n\r\n • lower thirds, title cards, openers, end slates\n\r\n • simple kinetic typography\n\r\n • stat/number callouts and on-screen text\n\r\n • infographic 2D animations\n\r\n • branded templates that can be reused\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-assisted video workflows (responsible use)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re excited by AI as a tool, not a shortcut. You’ll use AI to improve speed and quality, for example:\n\r\n\n\r\n • transcription / captioning\n\r\n • rough assemblies\n\r\n • cleanup tasks (audio enhancement, upscaling, rotoscoping, object removal where appropriate)\n\r\n • experimenting with AI-supported motion/graphics workflows\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll always keep outputs brand-safe and client-appropriate, and we’ll be clear on what tools are approved for each project.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat “good” looks like\n\r\n\n\r\n • You can take a brief + footage + notes and make smart editorial decisions without hand-holding.\n\r\n • You keep projects organised, versioned correctly, and easy to review.\n\r\n • You communicate clearly, flag risks early, and deliver on time.\n\r\n • You care about craft: sound, rhythm, structure, and the tiny details clients notice.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements (must-have)\n\r\n\n\r\n • 5+ years professional editing experience (agency, studio, or in-house brand team)\n\r\n • Excellent editing in Adobe Premiere Pro (or equivalent, but Premiere preferred)\n\r\n • Strong working knowledge of After Effects for motion graphics\n\r\n • Strong storytelling instincts + pacing + editorial judgment\n\r\n • Solid audio approach (dialogue clarity, levelling, basic cleanup)\n\r\n • Comfortable with feedback and revision cycles (\n-style notes)\n\r\n • Reliable internet + dependable computer setup\n\r\n • Able to overlap a few hours with UK working time for feedback (not full UK hours)\n\r\n\n\r\nNice-to-have\n\r\n\n\r\n • Experience in corporate/internal comms, employer brand, or documentary-style edits\n\r\n • Understanding of brand guidelines and template-based editing\n\r\n • Familiarity with tools like \n, Dropbox/Drive, Notion/Monday-style workflows\n\r\n • Colour correction confidence (clean, natural corporate look)\n\r\n • Experience creating reusable motion templates for lower thirds/titles                ",

    "description": "\n                    ## Job Title\n\r\n\n\r\nPersonal Virtual Assistant -- Organized, Proactive, AI-Friendly\n\r\n\n\r\n## Job Description\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm a tech entrepreneur running multiple projects (a software company, investments, and a DJ side business). I'm looking for a sharp, organized virtual assistant to be my right hand on the operations side of things.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't a typical VA role. **You'll essentially be my number two** -- helping me run things, not just checking off tasks. I need someone who takes ownership, builds systems, thinks strategically, and holds me accountable. If I'm dragging my feet on something, I expect you to follow up and push me to get it done. If you're someone who waits quietly for the next task, this isn't the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n### What You'll Be Doing\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Document & file organization** -- Organizing Google Drive, cloud storage, and local files. Building folder structures and naming conventions. Proactively thinking about ways to improve our efficiency and readiness for taxes and other document-heavy events -- not just organizing once, but creating systems that stay organized.\n\r\n- **Personal admin & gifting** -- Researching and ordering gifts for friends, family, and business contacts. Handling purchases and managing recurring personal tasks that keep falling through the cracks.\n\r\n- **Travel booking & points optimization** -- Booking travel, tracking my points balances across programs, and recommending the best way to use them for each trip. Proactively flagging deals and redemption opportunities.\n\r\n- **Calendar & scheduling** -- Coordinating meetings, blocking focus time, keeping me on track.\n\r\n- **Sales operations & client support** -- I handle the selling, but you help close the loop. Sending out DocuSigns, following up with clients, preparing contracts and consulting agreements, and handling the admin side of closing deals.\n\r\n- **Copywriting** -- Drafting copy for consulting proposals, client-facing\ns, social media posts, and other communications as needed.\n\r\n- **Product & market research** -- Researching competitors, market positioning, and user needs for new applications I'm building. You'll be my thought partner on this, not just a data gatherer.\n\r\n- **AI tools & marketing research** -- Staying on top of new AI tools and marketing strategies. Identifying what we should be using and how to implement them.\n\r\n- **Content summarization** -- Summarizing articles, reports, and content I haven't had time to read. We'll build an AI-assisted workflow for this together.\n\r\n\n\r\n### What Makes You Stand Out\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're a systematizer.** The first time you do something, you document it. You create SOPs, checklists, and templates so it never has to be figured out twice. You think in systems, not one-off tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're proactive and direct.** You don't wait to be told what to do next. You see what needs doing and you flag it. You're comfortable being frank with me -- if something is falling behind, you say so.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're organized and trustworthy.** You manage details without dropping balls. You handle sensitive information (finances, personal accounts) with discretion.\n\r\n\n\r\n**You can think independently.** When I give you a goal, you figure out the steps. You don't need every decision made for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Required Skills\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong English communication (written and verbal)\n\r\n- Google Workspace (Drive, Docs, Sheets, Calendar)\n\r\n- Notion (or similar project management/knowledge base tools)\n\r\n- Comfortable with video calls and async communication\n\r\n\n\r\n### Nice to Have\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) -- I'm happy to teach this if you're a fast learner\n\r\n- Ability to set up Slack integrations and automations\n\r\n- Experience with travel booking and points/miles optimization\n\r\n- Previous experience as a personal or executive assistant\n\r\n- Bookkeeping or basic financial organization experience\n\r\n\n\r\n### Schedule & Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Starting at 10 hours/week** with the opportunity to scale to full-time as we build trust and the workload grows\n\r\n- **$300/month retainer** to start\n\r\n- Flexible hours -- I care about output, not when you're online\n\r\n- Long-term role -- I'm looking for someone to grow with, not a short-term hire\n\r\n\n\r\n### How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. A brief intro about yourself and your experience as a VA\n\r\n2. Tell me about a time you created a system or process that made your client's life easier\n\r\n3. What AI tools do you currently use, if any? (It's okay if the answer is none -- I value honesty over a padded resume)\n\r\n4. Your availability and preferred working hours\n\r\n\n\r\nI'll be doing a 30-minute video interview with shortlisted candidates, followed by a small paid test task so we can both see if the fit is right.

The editing energy leans closer to a perfectly-timed After Effects edit / storytelling than a corporate product video. (You have an eye for aesthetics and cinematography)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will receive a script, a voiceover file, and a mood reference. Your job is to build the scene from nothing: generate AI visuals, voiceovers, source archival footage, layer sound design, and deliver a short where every second earns the next. A visual storyteller. (We provide access to the frontier generation models)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Style\n\r\n\n\r\nYES: Dark luxury. Museum. AE VFX edit. Stylish/Lethal. Fun. Rich textures. Clean typography. Controlled palette. Both silence and impact used with intention.\n\r\n\n\r\nNO: CapCut default presets. Anything that looks like a stock photo slideshow or a corporate deck.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou understand that more effects does not necessarily mean better. Every cut has a reason.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Skills (Non-Negotiables)\n\r\n\n\r\nMotion Graphics - You can build scenes, transitions, and visual elements from scratch in After Effects - not just cut footage.\n\r\n\n\r\nVoiceover-First Storytelling - You are editing to a narration primarily, music track second. You know when to let a line breathe and when to accelerate. You never bury the script's punchline under a flashy transition. The voice leads - the visuals serve.\n\r\n\n\r\nRetention Instinct - You understand that the first frame is an ad for the second frame. You know what stops a scroll. You build hooks visually, not just with text overlays. Every 2–3 seconds, something changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nRhythm & Beat-Sync - You can sync cuts, zooms, and effects to music. You understand \"the drop.\" If you've made AMVs, fan/anime edits, or phonk edits, you already have this skill - we want you to apply it with restraint.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI-Assisted Asset Creation - You are comfortable generating images and short clips using tools like Midjourney or Kling. (We usually move onto new tools as soon as they are released). You treat AI as a production tool, not a novelty. We provide all paid accounts - you bring the creative judgment.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Skills (Not Required, But We'll Notice)\n\r\n\n\r\n- After Effects compositing - Mocha tracking, light matching (future projects will involve product placement in video scenes)\n\r\n- Typography sense - fonts that feel intentional, never default\n\r\n- Color grading - pushing AI output and footage into a consistent palette\n\r\n- Sound design beyond music - layering SFX on movement, crafting risers and hits\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Output\n\r\n\n\r\nRamp-up (first 2–3 weeks): 2–3 shorts as you learn the brand voice and pipeline.\n\r\nSteady state: 4–5 shorts per week at the locked quality standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work from clear creative briefs with reference scripts, mood boards, and audio clips for most batches.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nDo not send a generic cover letter.\n\r\nUse 7 apply points or more when applying.\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: Lethal Editor - [Your name]\n\r\n\n\r\nSend the following (in this order):\n\r\n\n\r\n1. The Story Test. Link to ONE short-form video you edited that includes voiceover or spoken dialogue. We need to see that you can pace visuals to a script.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. The AE Style Test. Link to ONE video that shows your visual rhythm and editing craft - an AMV, fan edit, fashion reel, or anything where the editing itself is the skill. It doesn't need to be \"dark\" or \"luxury.\" It needs to show us how you think about pacing and impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. AI Experience (1 sentence). What is your experience level with generative AI tools (Midjourney, seedream, Kling, etc.)? If none, say so - we'll evaluate the rest of your application on its own merits.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Hardware. Your PC specs: CPU / GPU / RAM. Plus your internet upload speed.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Turnaround Estimate. How long does a 30–50 second high-quality short typically take you, start to finish?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. The Rewrite. Rewrite this sentence to sound dark, powerful, and modern: \"She is really cool and strong and she wins.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nPaid Trial (Shortlisted Candidates)\n\r\n\n\r\nBefore any full-time commitment, we run a weekly paid trial. We provide real scripts and style references. You deliver 30–50 second shorts. Trial is compensated at $250 USD at the end of each week (after work). If it's a mutual fit after 30 days, we transition to $550 USD payments every 2 weeks (before work).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis protects both of us - you see whether the work fits your strengths, we see whether the output fits our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- Paid accounts for all frontier AI tools; seedance2.0, seedream5.0, etc.\n\r\n- Creative identity - you're building the visual identity of a brand from launch, not filling someone else's template\n\r\n- Clear briefs - most, if not every batch comes with scripts, audio files, mood boards, and specific reference videos\n\r\n- Direct feedback - specific, constructive notes on every edit.\n\r\n- A brand worth building - Prismiera launches April 2026. A second AI native game/anime brand after that. You're not joining a machine. You're helping build one.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Fix Structured Data, Canonicals, H1 Issues + Improve CWV Performance\n\r\n\n\r\nHi! My name is Rhett and I'm the  Marketing Manager at The Equine Practice Company -\n\r\n\n\r\nI’m looking for an experienced Technical SEO Specialist to help fix several technical issues identified that we have with our website.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Equine Practice Company - a continuing education platform for equine veterinarians worldwide.\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me make this very clear before you apply.\n\r\n\n\r\n- This is not a content role or keyword research role.\n\r\n- This is a hands-on technical implementation project focused on:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Structured data (Schema / JSON-LD)\n\r\n- Entity linking (Organization ? Speakers)\n\r\n- Canonical + redirect consistency\n\r\n- Core Web Vitals performance improvements\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a one-time technical SEO implementation project (I'm estimating 1–2 weeks). I'd prefer a fixed-price structure with clear milestones. If the work is done well, I may offer ongoing technical SEO support for future schema + performance needs to this website and our second website.\n\r\n\n\r\nI want someone who can fix this properly and document the work clearly. \n\r\n\n\r\nA. Current Website Setup\n\r\n\n\r\nTo save time, here is our technical environment:\n\r\n\n\r\nWebsite platform: WordPress\n\r\nTheme: Kadence\n\r\nSEO plugin: Rank Math\n\r\nHosting: WPX (Cloudflare available)\n\r\nCanonical preference: I don’t mind www vs non-www - I just want one version enforced consistently\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Schema & Structured Data Implementation (High Priority) We currently have gaps in structured data, and we need a clean schema setup using best practices.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will implement:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Organization schema site-wide\n\r\n- AboutPage schema\n\r\n- ContactPage schema + ContactPoint\n\r\n- Person schema for our “Meet the Speaker” pages\n\r\n- Proper entity linking (Organization ? Website ? Speakers)\n\r\n\n\r\nI want a hybrid approach:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Rank Math for baseline schema\n\r\n- Custom JSON-LD where needed (especially for Speaker Person schema)\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: Avoid duplicate/conflicting schema output.\n\r\n\n\r\nAll schema must be validated using:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Google Rich Results Test\n\r\n- \n Validator\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Homepage SEO Fix (H1 Hierarchy) - Our homepage currently has two H1 tags, which causes structural confusion for Google.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Fix the heading hierarchy (single clean H1)\n\r\n- Keep design intact (Kadence blocks)\n\r\n\n\r\nSuggested H1:\n\r\n\n\r\n“The Equine Practice Company – Continuing Education for Equine Veterinarians”\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Canonical + Domain Consistency (WWW vs Non-WWW) - We may have canonical duplication issues.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Audit canonical tags across templates\n\r\n- Enforce one preferred domain version via proper 301 redirects\n\r\n- Ensure Rank Math canonicals match server/CDN redirects\n\r\n- Confirm consistent indexing in Google Search Console\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Core Web Vitals + Performance Improvements (CWV) - Because this is a membership-based site, performance matters.\n\r\n\n\r\nI need help improving:\n\r\n\n\r\n- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)\n\r\n- TTFB (Time to First Byte)\n\r\n- INP / CLS issues if present\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Identify the top causes of poor CWV (mobile-first)\n\r\n- Optimize heavy scripts/plugins where possible\n\r\n- Recommend hosting/CDN improvements if needed\n\r\n\n\r\nRetest using:\n\r\n\n\r\n- PageSpeed Insights\n\r\n- Lighthouse\n\r\n- CrUX data\n\r\n\n\r\nIt is important that you document before/after results.\n\r\n\n\r\nMost Importantly, The Final Deliverables (What You Must Provide)\n\r\n\n\r\nAt completion of this project for our website, I expect:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Working JSON-LD schema for Organization, AboutPage, ContactPage, Person\n\r\n- Clean entity graph \n\r\n- Validation proof (screenshots or links)\n\r\n- Canonical + redirect mapping summary\n\r\n- Before/after homepage H1 structure proof\n\r\n- Core Web Vitals improvement report\n\r\n- Clear documentation of everything changed\n\r\n\n\r\n? Screening Questions (Required)\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply for this task, please answer these:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What schema does Rank Math output by default, and how do you avoid duplication when adding custom Person schema?\n\r\n2. Where would you enforce the canonical domain version (WordPress vs Cloudflare vs server)?\n\r\n3. Share one example of Organization + Person JSON-LD you have implemented before (client details can be hidden).\n\r\n\n\r\nWho Is My Ideal Candidate - I'm looking for someone with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong WordPress technical SEO experience\n\r\n- Deep schema + JSON-LD knowledge (not just plugins)\n\r\n- Experience with Rank Math + Kadence themes\n\r\n- Understanding of Core Web Vitals (TTFB/LCP)\n\r\n- Ability to work independently and document clearly\n\r\n\n\r\nTimeline\n\r\n\n\r\nI want this completed within 7–14 days, depending on scope and testing. If you are a real technical implementer (not just an SEO auditor), I’d love to work with you.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease apply with your answers to the screening questions and provide me with a fix price to complete this project on our website.
