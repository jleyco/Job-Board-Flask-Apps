All done for them. We're scaling and need someone who can own the production and quality of what we deliver.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a button-clicking role.\n\r\n\n\r\nYes, you'll have video SOPs for every task. But we need someone who understands WHY we do things, not just HOW. You'll be running pre-made AI automations, building course portals, setting up\n sequences, and producing launch assets—but you'll also be quality-checking everything before it reaches a paying client. That means you need to actually know what good looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you can't tell the difference between a weak subject line and a strong one, if you can't spot when a course module is out of order, if you read \"I facilitate transformational journeys that empower individuals to unlock their authentic potential\" and don't immediately want to rewrite it — this isn't the role for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you'll be doing:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Running AI automations and quality checking the outputs before they go anywhere\n\r\n- Building course portals from templates and adapting them per client\n\r\n- Reviewing course scripts and curricula for logical flow, engagement, and clarity\n\r\n- Reviewing sales copy,\n sequences, and landing page content for persuasion and tone\n\r\n- Setting up\n sequences and launch assets\n\r\n- Formatting slides, workbooks, quizzes, and supplementary materials\n\r\n- Managing multiple client projects simultaneously without dropping balls\n\r\n- Flagging problems before they reach the client — not after\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you need:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Genuine understanding of online course structure — you know what makes a course flow well and what makes students drop off\n\r\n- Copywriting awareness — you can spot a weak CTA, a boring subject line, or a sales\n that doesn't convert\n\r\n-\n marketing knowledge — you understand how a nurture sequence differs from a launch sequence and why\n 4 does something different to\n 7\n\r\n- Familiarity with the coaching and consulting space — you understand how coaches sell, who their audiences are, and what transformation-based language looks like\n\r\n- Problem-solving instinct — when something breaks, you try to fix it before asking for help. If you're stuck after 15 minutes, you flag it with what you've already tried\n\r\n- Tech comfortable — Google Drive, course platforms,\n tools, project management software, AI tools. You don't need to know them all but you need to learn fast without hand-holding\n\r\n- Strong English — you're reading and reviewing client-facing content. Grammar, tone, and clarity matter\n\r\n- Available during UK business hours, preference for 4am-12pm UK overlap\n\r\n- Reliable — deadlines matter and if you say it's done, it's done properly\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat makes this different:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Full video training for every task — but we trust you to think beyond them\n\r\n- If you find a better way to do something, we want to hear it\n\r\n- Your work goes directly to paying clients — you'll see the impact immediately\n\r\n- Growth path into team lead or production manager as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nFill out this form: \n\r\n\n\r\nDo not apply via OnlineJobs.ph message.

(Be specific about your exact steps)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. **Learning & Problem-Solving:**\n\r\nDescribe a specific time you were asked to use a tool or platform you'd never used before. What was it? How did you learn it? How long did it take? What resources did you use?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. **Work Style:**\n\r\nOur previous VA would go silent for days when they hit problems or didn't know something.

Subject line format is specified below and must include GIG. Apply any time in 2026. \n\r\n\n\r\nHello! My name is EVE SUTTON (she/her). I am a teacher who works on curriculum design online for levels K-12 and Adult, and other projects for consumer education.  I write LOOONG instructions, so you must have excellent English skills for reading comprehension!  Projects include affiliate marketing, a WordPress website, and YouTube channels.  Everything is customized as we work together -- NO Woo Commerce, NO ready-made WordPress templates.   I specify the color pallet as web-safe HEX codes. I specify the font style and sizes.  I have rules for how we name each file and what formats we use for each project.  If you like rules, we will work well together!\n\r\n\n\r\nMost work is done in real time while we share a screen on TEAMS: You do not need to show your face but you will follow my instructions while I watch for ways to improve the process. Highest need Feb 2026 is developing a WordPress site for affiliate marketing of consumer protection (bike locks, home security, anti-theft products) using Lasso to enhance the affiliate links  (GetLasso.co) . Typical process: I get an idea, I research the details, then you do some research that I describe,  we develop the work flow, find why it will not work, try again, etc. I do not mind if we take forever to create the first version and keep modifying -- as long as the end result is top quality: Easy to use, self-sustaining, high SEO, high conversion to sales and profits, etc.  Be patient as I change my instructions with new ideas during the meetings.  \n\r\n\n\r\nHours: 5-10 hours per week until we are really moving quickly to finish a project, then up to 30 hours/week.  We arrange each meeting time a day or two in advance, and you will call me at the exact start time we arrange. I have worked with Philippine VAs for 2 years so I understand if typhoons or other events interrupt our plans, but you should be reliable generally. I pay by the hour because I change my mind often as we design new projects and I learn what will or will not work. I usually pay after each session through PayPal, unless we agree to have you send an invoice a day or two later. Later you might do small amounts of work on your own, after we have a very clear plan.  Yes, I micro-manage!  This job post is a good test of your ability to follow exact instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you are ready to work, please  Reply to \n  with this exact format  (example below)  for SUBJECT: \n\r\nPhil VA Teams GIG _____: ________, ____ PhP/hour [or $___/hour]\n\r\n[write your Online VA name after Gig: ] : [write your main skills], [Write your hourly rate in PhP  or US Dollars; I can pay either way through PayPal]  \n\r\n\n\r\nExample SUBJECT:  Phil VA Teams GIG Lupe A.
