Or is everything electronic? ?\n\r\n- Does your centre have any budget for books? ?\n\r\n- So you’re able to get the material that you need from time to time? ?\n\r\n- And, I guess you’re in charge of all of that aren’t you?\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay, that’s great. We’ll get that free book to you immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nJust confirming, your address is: XYZ Is that the best address to send it to?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’ll send that book off. What I like to do after a couple of weeks, is I would like to just give you a ring and get your opinion about the book (Name).\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, what’s the best way to reach you (try to get phone number and\n)?\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay, thank you (Name) I’ll send that free book to you straight away.

Founded by sisters Léonie and Lisa, OYO started with gentle, skin-first formulas and honest communication. Over time, the brand has grown into a category-defining hair removal and intimate care business, led by our hero product, Bye Bye Bush. Today, OYO is a focused, founder-led DTC brand with a clear product vision, strong customer loyalty, and high standards for how we build, market, and communicate.\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re hiring this role because our relationship with our customers matters deeply. As OYO grows, that relationship deserves more care, not less. This role exists to protect brand trust by making sure every interaction feels clear, timely, and genuinely supportive.\n\r\n\n\r\nAt its core, this role represents OYO wherever our customers meet us. You’re the voice behind the inbox, the calm presence in a DM, and the thoughtful reply when something goes wrong — or when something goes right. You’ll own customer conversations end-to-end, helping make things right when needed and reinforcing trust every step of the way.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll sit within the customer experience team as an individual contributor, working closely with the Customer Experience Lead, operations, and fulfillment partners. While this isn’t a leadership role, it carries meaningful responsibility, visibility, and autonomy across the business.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n- Own customer interactions across all platforms and marketplaces, including\n, DMs, ad comments, Amazon, Trustpilot, website reviews, Reddit, and TikTok Shop.\n\r\n- Ensure every customer message is acknowledged and resolved with care, clarity, and consistency.\n\r\n- Guide customers post-purchase by answering questions, resolving issues, and supporting refunds, replacements, or order concerns.\n\r\n- Maintain a warm, grounded, and on-brand voice that reflects OYO’s values at every touchpoint.\n\r\n- Capture customer feedback, recurring issues, and patterns, and escalate insights or risks to the Customer Experience Lead.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n- You’re comfortable taking ownership and seeing things through, even when the answer isn’t obvious at first.\n\r\n- You care deeply about how people feel, not just whether a problem is technically “resolved.”\n\r\n- You communicate clearly and kindly, with strong empathy and follow-through.\n\r\n- You stay grounded under pressure and approach challenges with curiosity and care.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools & Setup\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired:\n\r\n- Experience working with customer support platform\n\r\n- Experience navigating Shopify on the CS end\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\n- Experience supporting an e-commerce or beauty brand\n\r\n- Experience working with Amazon and TikTok Shop\n\r\n- Familiarity with help centres, FAQs, or saved responses\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join OYO\n\r\n\n\r\nOYO is a small, founder-led brand with:\n\r\n\n\r\n- A clear product vision and hero SKU\n\r\n- High ownership, low bureaucracy\n\r\n- Real responsibility and impact from day one\n\r\n- Long-term collaboration in mind, not short-term churn\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be trusted to own your role, contribute meaningfully, and help shape how the brand evolves.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply:\n\r\n\n\r\n-\n \n\r\n- Subject line: [Role Title] – Your Name\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\n                    Job Description\n\nI am looking for a Market Research Analyst who genuinely enjoys \"finding the needle in the haystack.\" This is not a mindless data-entry role. I need a critical thinker who can look at a spreadsheet, look at a map, and tell a story.\n\nIf you are someone who likes solving puzzles and \"reading between the lines\" of data, you will thrive here.\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\nYour job is to identify high-probability investment pockets using our proprietary multi-step filtration system. You will be moving from broad macro data sets down to surgical, local market validation. We find the \"Sleeper Markets\" that everyone else misses.\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nQuantitative Screening: Use specialized data platforms to identify markets that meet our specific benchmarks.\n\nQualitative Validation: \"Put eyes on the ground\" via the MLS to verify if the data matches reality.\n\nInvestigative Analysis: You are responsible for making a hypothesis. Don't just report the numbers, explain why a market looks a certain way.\n\nMonday.com Reporting: Maintain a clean, high-level board of candidate markets for our acquisitions team.\n\n\n\nWho You Are (The Detective)\n\nThe \"Why\" Thinker: You aren’t satisfied with a \"Median Price.\" You want to know why one property sold in 10 days and another sold in 200. You seek to understand the story behind the data.\n\n\n\nThe Real Estate Pro: You understand that land value is driven by more than just location—you understand how topography, listing quality, and buyer \"views/saves\" signal a hot market.\n\n\n\nPattern Recognizer: You can spot the \"Heartbeat\" reading between the lines\n\nWho You Are NOT (The Clerk)\n\n\n\nA Button-Clicker: If you want to follow a checklist blindly without thinking, please do not apply.\n\n\n\nAI-Reliant: We use tech, but we win because of human intuition. If you let a software \"score\" make the final call without verifying it, you’ll miss the gold.\n\n\n\nAbout Me\n\nMy name is Zach. I run a highly focused and intentional land acquisitions business. I’m looking for a market analyst with a critical eye, not just a task-runner.\n\nI live in metro Detroit. Go Lions!\n\nI’m usually outside hiking with my dog, enjoying the Great Lakes, or at the gym.\n\nA little tenant I have is Movement, Music, Mindset! If you value growth and intentionality, we will get along great.\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\nPlease put the number 909 and the current temperature in your city at the very top of your response.\n\nSelection Process: \n\n1. Initial application review. \n\n2. Interview\n\n3. A $50 Paid Trial Day for the top 2 finalists (includes 2 hours of training and a live market hunt).                ",

    "description": "\n                    We run a portfolio of short-term rental properties in the US. We're looking for someone who can own the day-to-day operations. Not just follow instructions, but think, solve problems, and make decisions without being told what to do.\n\r\nThis is not a task-execution role. We need someone who can manage guest communications, coordinate maintenance, handle escalations, and keep everything running smoothly while we focus on growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do:\n\r\n\n\r\nRespond to all guest messages quickly and professionally. Coordinate with cleaners and maintenance. Follow up until it's done, don't just send a message and hope. Handle guest issues using good judgment, including refund decisions and resolving bad experiences. Fight Airbnb disputes and process damage claims. Manage and oversee other tea\nmbers. Spot problems before they become emergencies. Take initiative. If something's broken, fix it or figure out how.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to haves: clickUp or related project management tool experience. Operational expertise. Leadership experience. Previous Airbnb jobs \n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\nYou think fast and don't need to be told the same thing twice. You can make decisions without asking for permission on every little thing. You write clearly and professionally in English. You treat this like your own business, not just a job.\n\r\nExperience in short-term rentals, property management, or hospitality is a plus. If you've worked at Airbnb support or know how to navigate AirCover, file claims, and win disputes, that's a bonus. Familiarity with ClickUp or similar project management tools is a plus. But what matters most is how you think, not where you've worked.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation:\n\r\nUp to $1,200 per month based on experience. Performance bonuses available for response time, guest reviews, and successful Airbnb claims. This is a full-time role with real growth potential for the right person.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your resume and a Loom video (3-5 minutes) answering the following scenario:\n\r\n\n\r\n\"It's 2 PM on a Friday. Here's your situation:\n\r\nThe Maple Street property is a 4-bedroom house. There's a guest checking in at 4 PM with a total reservation of $1,800. Your cleaner Maria just texted that her car broke down and she can't make it. The unit hasn't been cleaned.\n\r\n\n\r\nAt the River House, a 2-bedroom condo, a guest named Marcus checked in this morning. His total reservation is $260. He sends photos showing hair in the bathroom and dusty surfaces. He's frustrated.\n\r\n\n\r\nAt the Elm Court property, a 3-bedroom house, you have a guest checking in at 4 PM with a total reservation of $950. The previous guest reported the heat isn't working when they left this morning. It's 20 degrees outside. You called your HVAC tech and the earliest he can come is 6 PM.\n\r\n\n\r\nWalk me through your next few hours. How do you prioritize? What do you do about the cleaning emergency? How do you handle Marcus? What do you do about the Elm Court guest who's going to show up to a freezing house two hours before the tech arrives?\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm not looking for textbook answers. I want to see how you think, how you solve problems when the normal options don't work, and whether you'd take initiative to find solutions on your own.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications without a Loom video will not be considered.

You’ve mastered the tools, you’ve memorized the algorithms, and you’re tired of playing \"small ball.\" You don't just want to rank keywords; you want to dominate markets and eventually lead the entire operation.\n\r\nWe are not looking for a \"worker.\" We are looking for a future leader.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Mission\n\r\nAt our agency, we don’t \"do SEO.\" \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe build digital empires. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’ve hit 50+ clients in a year and are now on a warpath to 10x our revenue. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo do that, we need an SEO Architect—someone who uses AI as a weapon, not a crutch, and who views a Google penalty or \"shadow ban\" as a puzzle to be solved, not a reason to panic.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are (The Commander’s Profile)\n\r\nThe AI Alchemist: You don’t just \"use\" ChatGPT. You engineer complex prompts and custom GPTs to automate audits, map user intent, and predict SERP shifts. You are obsessed with finding the $1+1=10$ efficiency in AI workflows.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Crisis Specialist: When a site gets \"shadow banned\" or tanked by a Core Update, you don't send a \"wait and see\"\n. You move into the war room, dismantle the site’s authority signals, identify the \"helpful content\" mismatch, and execute a surgical recovery plan.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Growth Obsessive: You pursue Mastery, Autonomy, and Purpose. You aren't looking for a \"comfortable\" job; you’re looking for the fastest route to a leadership position where you have total ownership of results.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Technical Translator: You can sit with a developer and talk server-side rendering, then turn around and explain to a CEO exactly how that technical fix will 2x their ROI.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Arsenal (What You’ll Be Doing)\n\r\nLead the AI Frontier: Architect the agency’s AI-SEO workflow. You will be responsible for staying 6 months ahead of the industry in how we use LLMs for content strategy and technical automation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrategic Troubleshooting: Solve the \"unsolvable\" SEO problems—manual actions, algorithmic de-indexing, and sophisticated crawl budget issues.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nRevenue-First SEO: You will link every backlink and every line of code to the client’s bottom line. If it doesn't drive revenue, we don't do it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTea\nntorship: As you master our systems, you will begin building and leading your own squad of \"Digital Warriors,\" scaling your expertise across the entire agency.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Code You Live By\n\r\n3+ Years in the Trenches: You’ve seen updates come and go. You don’t flinch at a red graph; you find the leverage point to turn it green.\n\r\nPrompt Engineering Mastery: You can demonstrate how you use AI to do 10 hours of work in 30 minutes without sacrificing an ounce of quality.\n\r\nExtreme Ownership: You don't blame \"the algorithm.\" You take responsibility for the outcome.\n\r\nGlobal Vision: You understand the nuances of International SEO and how to build authority in any market, on any scale.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Pay-Off\n\r\nLeadership Track: We are hiring you to eventually run the SEO department. Prove your worth, and the keys are yours.\n\r\nHigh-Stakes Compensation: We don't lowball. We pay for performance and elite skill.\n\r\nRadical Autonomy: Work from anywhere. We don't care about your hours; we care about your impact.\n\r\nThe \"No BS\" Guarantee: We fire nightmare clients who don’t listen. We protect our warriors.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly apply thru here: \n                ",

The work requires careful attention to instructions, strong online research skills, and consistent daily delivery.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\n\n\r\nYour main task is to find and collect the front page of police crash reports using public sources and direct contact with police departments.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour daily workflow will include:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Search for recent car crashes using public city, county, or state portals.\n\r\n• Identify which police department handled each i\n.\n\r\n• Contact the correct police department and request ONLY the front page of the crash report (not the full report).\n\r\n• Gather as many valid reports as possible overnight.\n\r\n• Send all collected files to me before 7:00 AM (U.S. Mountain Time) each day.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou may use the provided example portals or your own research methods to locate i\n.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant Rules\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease follow these requirements exactly:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Reports must be less than 7 days old.\n\r\n• The front page must include names and addresses of the people involved.\n\r\n• Do NOT submit FOIA requests unless specifically approved. FOIA requests often take 10–14 days, which is too slow for this project.\n\r\n• Many police departments can release the front page immediately under specific public-record laws. We only need that first page.\n\r\n\n\r\nExample Workflow\n\r\n\n\r\nVisit a public i\n portal, for example:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nFind a crash i\n with location and exact call time.\n\r\n\n\r\nContact the relevant police department.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequest the front page only using the address and call time so they can locate the correct report.\n\r\n\n\r\nCurrent Areas of Focus\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are currently collecting reports from:\n\r\n\n\r\nTexas\n\r\n• Amarillo\n\r\n• McAllen\n\r\n• El Paso\n\r\n\n\r\nOhio\n\r\n• Multiple areas (details will be provided)\n\r\n\n\r\nNew Mexico\n\r\n• Albuquerque\n\r\n• Additional cities will be added later\n\r\n\n\r\nMore regions will be assigned as the project grows.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n• Strong English communication skills\n\r\n• Ability to follow instructions carefully\n\r\n• Organized file handling and daily reporting\n\r\n• Comfortable contacting U.S. police departments professionally\n\r\n\n\r\nConsistency and accuracy are more important than speed alone.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you, and I look forward to working with you!

You will be editing finance talking head videos 10-15 minutes long. Let us know asap if you are interested!\n\r\n\n\r\nFormat Requirements:\n\r\nThe first 12-15 seconds of the video will be a dramatic and highly edited intro highlighting what the highlighted speaker is about to say, “coming up” in the video. \n\r\n\n\r\nAfterwards, you will add b-roll and related footage following our guidelines that is extremely relevant to what the speaker is saying throughout the video, like the reference.\n\r\n\n\r\nReference Videos: \n \n\r\n\n\r\nThe pay for this project is $2.00-$2.50 per minute of the final video depending on the complexity. If you do the job well, we will have more videos for you to work on per day.\n\r\nPlease attach previous relevant projects/portfolio you have done for reference, thanks!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nEditing guidelines:\n\r\nWe are looking for simple but effective editing. You will add editing to help the viewer better understand what is being said in the video, avoiding spamming random editing or making it more confusing. You will cut out audio spaces above 0.5 seconds or stutters the speaker makes.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the first two mins, we will show b-roll and change every 8 seconds. We will switch between the tiny screen and the big screen. The speaker in the big screen format in the first 15 seconds and leave it there for 1-2 sentences. \n\r\nTiny screen: There is b-roll on the right hand side but the speaker is also featured on the left hand side.\n\r\nBig screen: This means that we just show the speaker talking without b-roll. It is good to do this when you don’t have any good ideas for which b-roll to put.\n\r\n\n\r\nNotes on B-roll:\n\r\nThe b-roll should not be annoying to the viewer and only show to help illustrate the point. Random b-rolls of a stock market or a random person that is not related does not help the viewer understand.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the b-roll, make sure it’s not something randomly generic. You should put some thought into what is being shown, not just randomly put the first image that pops up when search up. It is easy to tell.                ",

The objective is very pragmatic: deliver something that works reliably. UI polish, animations, and perfect design are not a priority at this stage. I will provide clear guidance, feedback, and quick iterations throughout the project.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe tool helps recruiters compare multiple CVs to a job description and quickly identify the most relevant candidates. The workflow is straightforward: upload CVs, create a job description, run a matching process, and display a ranked list of candidates with clear explanations (strengths, gaps, risks).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not an ATS, not a sourcing platform, and not a commercial product. It is an internal decision-support tool designed to save time and improve prioritization.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor this initial phase, the scope is intentionally limited to CVs only. No LinkedIn integration, no scraping, no authentication, and no billing. CV files are uploaded, parsed via an external API, stored in a database, compared to a job description, and displayed in a simple admin-style interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe technical stack is already defined and kept intentionally simple. You can use code, low-code, or a mix of both, as long as the result is a working MVP.\n\r\n\n\r\nEstimated scope: 15–25 hours. Initial paid test.\n\r\nPossible extension if the collaboration goes well.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, briefly describe a project where you built a functional MVP involving API integrations and data handling, and share your availability over the next two to three weeks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you,\n\r\nOliver                ",

    "description": "\n                    We're building Bible Guide, a faith-based mobile app that helps Christians deepen their faith through daily devotionals, guided prayer, Scripture-based AI chat, and personalized spiritual guidance. Our mission is simple: help people get closer to God, every day.\n\n\n\nWe're growing fast and looking for UGC creators to join us long-term and help get this app in front of the people who need it. We need authentic short-form videos. Reactions, testimonials, app walkthroughs, personal takes. The kind of content that feels like a real person genuinely sharing something they found, not a scripted ad.\n\n\n\nThis is a dedicated UGC role. You're not managing strategy or editing other people's footage. You're the face (or voice) on camera, creating content that feels native to the platform and natural to a US audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n???? WHAT YOU'LL DO\n\n\n\n- Create short-form UGC videos (30-90 seconds) for TikTok and Instagram Reels. Think reactions, personal testimonials, \"I found this app\" moments, app feature walkthroughs, day-in-my-life clips, that kind of thing.\n\n- Run your own TikTok and Instagram account dedicated to this content. We provide the accounts and a US residential address to connect them to.\n\n- Follow a warm-up routine we provide to get the account active and reaching the right audience. If you've done this before, great. If not, we'll guide you through it.\n\n- Post consistently based on a schedule we agree on together.\n\n- Experiment with different hooks, formats, and angles to find what resonates.\n\n- Keep it authentic. The content should feel like it belongs on someone's For You page, not like an ad.\n\n\n\n\n\n???? WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR\n\n\n\n- Comfortable on camera, or comfortable creating content that feels personal (voiceover, screen recordings with narration, etc.)\n\n- Good English. If you're a native or near-native speaker, you can speak directly on camera. If your spoken English isn't quite there, that's totally fine. You can use captions, text overlays, or AI-generated voiceover. What matters is the final content feels natural for a US/Western audience.\n\n- You know what works on TikTok and Instagram Reels. You know what a good hook looks like, you understand pacing, and you've scrolled enough to have a feel for what stops people.\n\n- Reliable and self-motivated. You'll be managing your own posting schedule and we need someone who actually follows through.\n\n- Open to the faith space. You don't need to be a theologian, but a genuine interest in or connection to the Christian faith helps the content feel real rather than forced. If you're someone who wants to use their creative skills to help bring people closer to God, this is the role.\n\n- Bonus: Experience running accounts from scratch, warming up new accounts, or working with VPN/residential proxy setups.\n\n\n\n\n\n???? HOW IT WORKS\n\n\n\n- You can be based anywhere in the world. US, Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, wherever. We're hiring globally to find great people at fair rates.\n\n- We provide a US residential address for your TikTok and Instagram accounts so the content reaches a US audience.\n\n- We provide an account warm-up guide. It's a step-by-step routine to get a new account active, established in the right niche, and reaching real viewers before you start posting content. If you've done this before, even better.\n\n- You'll run your own dedicated accounts. This isn't posting to our main brand account. You're building individual creator-style accounts that feel personal and authentic.\n\n- We'll work closely with you, especially at the start, to dial in what's working.\n\n\n\n\n\n???? PAY AND GROWTH\n\n\n\n- You'll be on a monthly retainer so you have a stable base and can focus on making great content without worrying about chasing hours.\n\n- On top of the retainer, you earn performance bonuses when your videos hit view milestones. When the content wins, you win. We want to be properly aligned on this.\n\n- This is a long-term role. We're not looking for someone to make a few videos and disappear. We want creators who want to grow with us, get better over time, and build something meaningful together.\n\n- As we scale, there's real room to grow your role and your earnings. The creators who stick around and perform well will be the backbone of how we reach people.\n\n\n\n\n\n???? HOW TO APPLY\n\n\n\nSend me:\n\n\n\n1. A short intro. Who you are, where you're based, and a bit about your background.\n\n2. 2-3 examples of UGC-style content you've created. This could be from your own accounts, client work, or even something you film as a quick sample. I want to see how you come across on camera or in voiceover, not a polished portfolio.\n\n3. Your rate or expected monthly retainer.\n\n4. A sentence or two on why this interests you, especially if you have any connection to the faith space.\n\n\n\nSerious candidates will be given a paid test video before we commit to anything ongoing.
