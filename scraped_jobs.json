This role evolves — as you grow, so will your responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / REQUIRED SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE:\n\r\nWe value curiosity, reliability, and the ability to take ownership. If you enjoy figuring things out, learning on the job, and taking initiative, you’ll thrive here.

We talk to editors, managers, strategists, and producers to extract the tactical frameworks they actually use. Our mission is to professionalize the creator economy :)\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE\n\r\nWe’re looking for a dedicated short-form video editor to own the entire shorts pipeline for Gimbal. You’ll take raw podcast footage and turn it into 10–14 scroll-stopping clips per week.\n\r\nThis is not a “slap captions on a clip” role. You’ll be expected to identify the best \nnts, craft hooks, structure edits for retention, and continuously improve based on performance data. You’ll work alongside our long-form editor (who handles the full episode) and our distribution manager (who handles posting and scheduling).\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\nCore: Short-Form Editing (80% of time)\n\r\n• Watch raw podcast footage and identify the 10–14 strongest clip-worthy \nnts per episode\n\r\n• Edit clips for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels, and LinkedIn (vertical 9:16 format)\n\r\n• Write hooks and structure each clip for maximum retention (not just trimming timestamps)\n\r\n• Add captions, text overlays, and light graphics to enhance the content\n\r\n• Source supplementary B-roll, images, and visual elements to keep clips visually engaging\n\r\n• Create or refine thumbnails for each short\n\r\nAnalytics & Optimization (15% of time)\n\r\n• Pull weekly performance numbers from YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram\n\r\n• Track what’s working: which hooks, formats, durations, and topics drive the most views\n\r\n• Compile a brief weekly performance summary with actionable takeaways\n\r\n• Use data to inform your editing decisions — we want someone who learns from the numbers, not just vibes\n\r\nAdjacent Tasks (5% of time)\n\r\n• Assist with B-roll sourcing and asset organization\n\r\n• Occasional light assistant editor tasks on long-form episodes as needed\n\r\n• Help maintain our content asset library\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\nMust-Have\n\r\n• Proven experience editing short-form video content (send us your portfolio or links to clips you’ve edited)\n\r\n• Strong eye for what makes a good hook — the first 1–2 seconds are everything\n\r\n• Proficiency in Premiere Pro, CapCut, or DaVinci Resolve (or similar)\n\r\n• Comfortable working with podcast/interview footage specifically\n\r\n• Ability to hit weekly deadlines consistently — we publish on a set schedule\n\r\n• Good written English (you’ll write captions, hooks, and short descriptions)\n\r\n• Reliable internet connection and self-managed work schedule\n\r\nNice-to-Have\n\r\n• Experience with YouTube analytics and understanding of platform algorithms\n\r\n• Familiarity with Notion (our team’s operating system)\n\r\n• Experience in the creator economy or podcast space\n\r\n• Basic motion graphics or After Effects skills\n\r\n• An opinion about what makes shorts succeed — we want someone who thinks critically about this!\n\r\n\n\r\nOUR STYLE\n\r\nProfessional but engaging. We’re not a \n page, but we’re not a corporate channel either. Think clean cuts, well-timed zooms, purposeful text overlays, and the occasional visual punch — without overdoing it. The content should feel polished and intentional, not templated.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nSend us:\n\r\n1. Your portfolio or links to short-form clips you’ve edited. Podcast clips are a huge plus. If you don’t have podcast clips, send whatever best shows your editing style and ability to hook a viewer.\n\r\n2. A short note (2–3 sentences) on what you think makes a short-form clip perform well.\n\r\n3. Your availability, desired salary, and preferred tools/software.\n\r\n4. BONUS: A 60 second video introducing yourself!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe review every application. If your work is strong, we’ll reach out to discuss a paid test edit.                ",

We are currently searching for our very first full-time creative team member. Because you are our first hire, you will not be lost in a massive corporate machine or treated as a disposable contractor. You will work directly with the founder to shape the visual output of our company. We believe in mutual growth, absolute respect for your time, and providing a stable, long-term environment for someone who is eager to learn and grow with us.\n\nRole Overview\n\nWe are seeking a highly organized, detail-oriented Video Editor who understands the unique nuances of professional content. Your primary objective will be to take raw footage, transform it into engaging, high-retention videos, and manage the administrative scheduling of those assets across our platforms.\n\nYou will be responsible for editing two distinct categories of content:\n\n1. Client Deliverables: Polished, professional videos tailored to the specific brand guidelines of our corporate clients.\n\n2. Internal Content Marketing: Educational videos, thought leadership clips, and promotional assets designed to market our own agency.\n\nThis role requires a critical balance of creative editing and administrative precision. You will not just be cutting footage; you will be the final step in our content distribution pipeline, ensuring that the right video goes live at the right time.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\n• Edit long-form and short-form videos (both vertical and horizontal formats) utilizing Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\n• Incorporate clean, professional motion graphics, lower-thirds, and text overlays suitable for a corporate audience. (Please note: We do not use frantic, over-edited \"influencer\" styles. We value clean, authoritative pacing that builds trust).\n\n• Perform essential color correction, audio leveling, and background noise reduction to ensure high production value.\n\n• Export finalized assets optimized for the compression algorithms of various platforms (LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram).\n\n• Upload completed videos, write basic accompanying social media captions, and schedule posts for distribution using the Metricool platform.\n\n• Utilize Metricool's \"Approval Workflow\" feature to submit drafts to management for review prior to final publication.\n\n• Maintain highly organized project files, folder structures, and secure cloud backups.\n\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\n• Proven, demonstrable experience utilizing Adobe Premiere Pro (Knowledge of After Effects is a fantastic bonus, but not strictly required for this role).\n\n• A strong portfolio demonstrating your ability to edit professional, narrative-driven content (such as talking heads, explainer videos, or podcasts).\n\n• Experience with, or a strong willingness to rapidly learn, Metricool for social media scheduling and analytics.\n\n• Excellent English comprehension and written communication skills for drafting basic social media copy.\n\n• A strong understanding of pacing, storytelling, and visual hierarchy.\n\n• Exceptional attention to detail—you meticulously review your own work before submitting it for approval.\n\nHardware & Technical Requirements\n\n(Due to the heavy processing requirements of video editing, please ensure your personal workstation meets these criteria before applying)\n\n• Processor (CPU): Intel Core i7 / AMD Ryzen 7 (or equivalent/newer) / Apple Silicon M1 or newer.\n\n• Memory (RAM): Minimum 16GB (32GB is highly preferred for a smooth 4K workflow).\n\n• Graphics (GPU): Dedicated GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1660 / RTX series or equivalent) with at least 4GB VRAM.\n\n• Storage: Solid State Drive (NVMe SSD preferred) to ensure fast playback of heavy files.\n\n• Internet: A highly stable connection with a minimum of 50 Mbps Download / 20 Mbps Upload speeds (this is crucial for downloading gigabytes of raw client files).\n\n• Power: Access to a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) or backup power during regional outages is highly preferred.\n\nWhat We Offer You\n\n• A stable, full-time monthly salary paid reliably on schedule via EasyPay or your preferred transfer method.\n\n• Statutory 13th-Month Pay (prorated based on your exact start date).\n\n• A flexible, output-based working environment. As long as deadlines are strictly met and communication is clear, we do not micromanage your daily hours.\n\n• The opportunity for significant career growth. As our first creative hire, successful performance will lead to increased responsibilities, leadership opportunities, and increased compensation as the business scales.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nWe receive a high volume of applications for our roles. To ensure we are reviewing candidates who possess the high attention to detail required for professional video editing, please follow these instructions perfectly. Applications that do not follow these steps will be immediately discarded.\n\n1. Change the subject line of your application\n to exactly: \"B2B Premiere Editor\"\n\n2. Provide a brief, 3-to-4 sentence introduction explaining why you are interested in transitioning into or continuing to work within business education content editing and content marketing.\n\n3. Include a direct link to your portfolio. Please explicitly point out 1 or 2 specific videos in your portfolio that best demonstrate clean, professional pacing and excellent audio management.\n\n4. Include a direct screenshot of your computer’s system specifications (showing CPU, RAM, and GPU) alongside a screenshot of a recent internet speed test.\n\nNote to Applicants: Shortlisted candidates will be invited to complete a short, time-bound trial task. This will involve editing 60 seconds of sample footage and drafting a theoretical Metricool upload sequence to ensure we are aligned on style and technical capability. You are welcome to heavily watermark this trial task to protect your intellectual property.                ",
