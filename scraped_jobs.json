    "description": "\n                    Job Description:\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe're a blockchain/DeFi company running production infrastructure that's bleeding money unnecessarily. Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you.

READ THIS FIRST — THIS IS NOT A TYPICAL CUSTOMER SERVICE JOB ??\n\r\n\n\r\nWe specialize in weatherstripping, rubber seals, and restoration parts \n\r\nfor classic and vintage American cars — Mustangs, Camaros, Chevelles, \n\r\nImpalas, C10s, and hundreds more. Our catalog includes door seals, \n\r\ntrunk seals, roof rail weatherstripping, window seals, and a rapidly \n\r\ngrowing selection of all types of classic car restoration parts — \n\r\nover 100,000 unique SKUs and counting.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur customers are restoration shops, classic car dealers, and diehard \n\r\ncar enthusiasts across the US.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen they call, they don't ask \"where's my package?\" — they ask:\n\r\n\"I installed new door seals on my '69 Camaro and now the doors are \n\r\nso hard to close I have to slam them — what's going on?\" or \"My trunk \n\r\nseal isn't sitting right in the corners and I'm getting water in the \n\r\ntrunk — did I get the wrong part?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n(We also have a few smaller side brands — eBikes, motorcycle parts, \n\r\ncar decals, hobby parts, and a publishing company — but those are only \n\r\n5-10% of your work and are simple customer service. If you can handle \n\r\nthe car parts, you can handle anything.)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have NO IDEA what a door seal bulb is or why orientation \n\r\nmatters when installing weatherstripping, this job is not for you.\n\r\nIf reading that made you curious (or excited), keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHO SHOULD APPLY (and who should NOT)\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n? APPLY if you:\n\r\n- Are a car guy/car girl — you wrench on cars, watch car builds, \n\r\n  or grew up around someone who does\n\r\n- Have worked in an auto parts store, repair shop, dealership, \n\r\n  or automotive call center\n\r\n- Can hold a real, unscripted phone conversation in English with \n\r\n  American customers for 8 hours a day — not just read a script\n\r\n- Understand what fitment means and why year/make/model matters\n\r\n- Can troubleshoot a customer's installation problem over the phone \n\r\n  using common sense, product knowledge, and the right questions\n\r\n- Actually ENJOY talking to people on the phone\n\r\n\n\r\n? DO NOT APPLY if you:\n\r\n- Have never worked with cars, car parts, or automotive customers\n\r\n- Are only comfortable on chat and\n (this role is 50%+ phone)\n\r\n- Struggle with unscripted, fast-paced English phone conversations\n\r\n- Are looking for a basic VA or data entry role\n\r\n- Don't know the difference between a disc brake and a drum brake\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n- Base: $900–$1,100 USD/month (depending on automotive experience)\n\r\n- 13th Month Pay: Yes\n\r\n- Paid Time Off: 10 days/year\n\r\n- Performance Bonus: Available after 6 months based on metrics\n\r\n- Payment: Weekly via Wise or PayPal\n\r\n\n\r\nWe pay at the top of the range for people who bring real \n\r\nautomotive knowledge. If you've worked in auto parts and are \n\r\ngreat on the phone, we'll pay for that.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nSCHEDULE\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n- Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM – 4:30 PM US Central Time\n\r\n  (That's 9:00 PM – 5:30 AM Manila Time)\n\r\n- Fixed schedule, no rotating shifts\n\r\n\n\r\n- 100% Work From Home\n\r\n- Must be based in the Philippines\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWe're a US-based company running several niche e-commerce brands. Our \n\r\nCORE business — and 90-95% of your workload — is classic and vintage \n\r\nAmerican car parts. We carry one of the deepest selections of \n\r\nweatherstripping, rubber seals, and restoration parts in the industry, \n\r\nand our catalog is expanding rapidly into all types of classic car \n\r\nparts — mechanical, electrical, trim, body, and more.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've been in this industry for decades. Our customers are restoration \n\r\nshops, classic car dealers, and everyday car enthusiasts across the US \n\r\nwho are passionate about keeping these vehicles on the road.\n\r\n\n\r\nA huge part of this role is helping customers select the right \n\r\nweatherstripping and seals for their specific car, and then \n\r\ntroubleshooting installation issues over the phone. Customers will \n\r\ncall with problems like:\n\r\n- \"I glued on my door seals and they're pulling away overnight\"\n\r\n- \"My trunk lid won't latch after I installed the new trunk seal\"\n\r\n- \"The roof rail weatherstrip won't sit right in the channel\"\n\r\n- \"Which adhesive should I be using for my door seals?\"\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need to be the person who can calmly walk them through it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWE ALSO RUN A FEW SMALLER BRANDS (5-10% of your workload):\n\r\n? eBike, motorized bike & motorcycle parts (if you know cars, \n\r\n  you can handle this)\n\r\n? Car graphic decals (same car-world customers)\n\r\n? A paranormal nonfiction publishing company\n\r\n? Hobby parts\n\r\n\n\r\nThese side brands are MUCH simpler — mostly \"where's my order?\" and \n\r\n\"how do I return this?\" type questions. No deep technical knowledge \n\r\nneeded. Think of it as a mental break between the challenging car \n\r\nparts calls.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you can handle the classic car parts work, the rest is easy.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is critical to our operation — you'll be the voice our \n\r\ncustomers hear and the person they trust for answers. Because of \n\r\nthat, our screening process is thorough. We want to make sure this \n\r\nis a great fit for both sides.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHAT A TYPICAL DAY LOOKS LIKE\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n? Check overnight\ns and tickets from customers\n\r\n? Answer inbound call: \"I need a complete weatherstrip kit for a \n\r\n  '72 Chevelle Malibu 2-door hardtop — what all comes in the kit?\"\n\r\n? Troubleshoot: \"I installed the door seals on my '68 Mustang and \n\r\n  now the doors won't close without slamming them. Is the seal \n\r\n  too thick or did I do something wrong?\"\n\r\n? Walk a customer through proper seal orientation — his trunk seal \n\r\n  is installed backwards and that's why it's not seating right\n\r\n? Help a restoration shop figure out which roof rail weatherstrip \n\r\n  they need for a '70 Chevelle — hardtop vs. convertible\n\r\n? Process a return: customer ordered the wrong trunk seal — verify \n\r\n  his year/make/model and help him get the correct one\n\r\n? Advise a first-time restorer on the right adhesive for his \n\r\n  door seals — he used silicone instead of contact cement and \n\r\n  everything is peeling off\n\r\n? Take a phone order from a repeat customer who needs window \n\r\n  seals, a firewall pad, and a set of bumper guards\n\r\n? Answer a customer\n about a paranormal book shipping date\n\r\n? Help someone pick the right decal size for their car\n\r\n? Process a return on a hobby parts order\n\r\n? Answer a basic question about an eBike battery or motorcycle part\n\r\n\n\r\nThe weatherstripping and seal calls are the challenging, rewarding \n\r\ncore of the work. The side brand questions are quick and simple — \n\r\nthey break up the day.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\nTECHNICAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT — CLASSIC CAR PARTS (90-95%):\n\r\n- Handle ~40–60 customer interactions/day (phone,\n, chat)\n\r\n- Answer inbound phone calls — order questions, fitment verification, \n\r\n  installation troubleshooting, returns\n\r\n- Help customers identify the correct weatherstripping, seals, and \n\r\n  parts using year/make/model, body style, and part numbers across \n\r\n  our 100,000+ SKU catalog\n\r\n- Troubleshoot installation issues over the phone — door seals, \n\r\n  trunk seals, roof rail weatherstripping, window seals, and a \n\r\n  growing range of all types of classic car restoration parts\n\r\n- Advise customers on proper installation techniques, adhesives, \n\r\n  surface prep, and seal orientation\n\r\n- Process returns and exchanges — determine root cause (wrong part \n\r\n  for their application, installation error, or defective product)\n\r\n- Take orders over the phone\n\r\n\n\r\nADDITIONAL BRAND SUPPORT (5-10% of volume):\n\r\n- Handle basic customer service \n, occasional phone) for our \n\r\n  other brands: eBike/motorcycle parts, car graphic decals, hobby \n\r\n  parts, and a paranormal nonfiction publishing company\n\r\n- These are straightforward order support questions — no technical \n\r\n  troubleshooting needed\n\r\n- We provide simple FAQ docs and response templates for these brands\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n???? MUST HAVE (Non-Negotiable):\n\r\n\n\r\n- AUTOMOTIVE KNOWLEDGE: You must have hands-on experience or working \n\r\n  knowledge of cars and car parts. You understand what year/make/model \n\r\n  fitment means. You know basic automotive terminology (not just from \n\r\n  Google — from experience). Acceptable backgrounds:\n\r\n    • Worked in an auto parts store or counter\n\r\n    • Worked in a repair shop, dealership, or body shop\n\r\n    • Automotive call center or technical support experience\n\r\n    • Serious car hobbyist/enthusiast who works on their own vehicles\n\r\n    • Automotive technology or mechanic vocational graduate\n\r\n\n\r\n- PHONE FLUENCY (Real, Not Rehearsed): You must be able to carry \n\r\n  natural, unscripted English conversations on the phone for hours \n\r\n  at a time. This means:\n\r\n    • You can think on your feet and respond naturally — not read \n\r\n      from a script\n\r\n    • You can handle frustrated customers calmly and professionally\n\r\n    • American customers can understand you clearly without asking \n\r\n      you to repeat yourself constantly\n\r\n    • You can explain technical concepts in simple terms\n\r\n    • You've done this professionally before (call center, phone \n\r\n      support, phone sales — at least 2 years)\n\r\n\n\r\n- TROUBLESHOOTING ABILITY: When a customer says \"I installed this \n\r\n  seal and it's not right,\" you don't panic. You ask the right \n\r\n  questions: What's the year/make/model? Which seal did they install? \n\r\n  Is the bulb facing the right direction? Did they prep the surface \n\r\n  and use the right adhesive? Can they send a photo? You use logic \n\r\n  and product knowledge to solve the problem.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Reliable internet: minimum 25 Mbps (test at \n before applying)\n\r\n- Quiet, dedicated home office for phone calls (no background noise)\n\r\n- Own computer with quality headset (noise-canceling preferred)\n\r\n- Available to work US Central Time hours (night shift PH time)\n\r\n\n\r\n????

We're a growing company and we reward \n\r\npeople who perform.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what growth looks like:\n\r\n- MASTER THE ROLE: Become the go-to expert our customers trust. \n\r\n  Build deep product knowledge across our catalog.\n\r\n- EARN MORE: As you prove yourself, we expand your responsibilities \n\r\n  — and your compensation grows with them. Top performers who take \n\r\n  on higher-level work earn significantly more.\n\r\n- ADVANCE: There are real opportunities to move into higher-paying \n\r\n  roles with more responsibility as the business grows. We promote \n\r\n  from within.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're not looking for someone to fill a seat for 6 months. We want \n\r\nsomeone who wants to build a career with us — and we'll invest in \n\r\nthe right person.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nOUR HIRING PROCESS (Read This Carefully)\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role demands real automotive knowledge and real phone skills — \n\r\nnot everyone has both. Our process is designed to find the person \n\r\nwho does. If that's you, this will be easy.\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 1: APPLICATION (below)\n\r\n- Submit your resume and cover letter\n\r\n- Complete the 5-question automotive knowledge quiz (below)\n\r\n- Record and submit your video application (details below)\n\r\n- You MUST include the word IGNITION somewhere in your cover \n\r\n  letter to confirm you read this entire posting\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 2: REVIEW & WRITTEN ASSESSMENT\n\r\n- We review applications and quiz scores\n\r\n- Top candidates receive a short written assessment: a customer \n\r\n \n scenario where you must help a customer identify the \n\r\n  right seal for their car and troubleshoot an installation issue\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 3: LIVE PHONE ROLEPLAY (This Is the Real Test)\n\r\n- We will call you unannounced (within a scheduled window) \n\r\n  and roleplay a real customer call scenario:\n\r\n    ? \"Hey, I just installed new door weatherstripping on my \n\r\n      1970 Chevelle and the doors are really hard to close now. \n\r\n      I have to basically slam them shut. I followed the \n\r\n      instructions but something's not right. Can you help?\"\n\r\n- We're evaluating: Can you think on your feet? Do you ask \n\r\n  smart diagnostic questions? (Did you prep the surface? What \n\r\n  adhesive did you use? Is the seal oriented correctly? Have you \n\r\n  tried adjusting the striker?) Are you calm and professional? \n\r\n  Can we understand you clearly? Do you sound like someone our \n\r\n  customers would trust?\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 4: OFFER & PAID TRIAL WEEK\n\r\n- Start with a paid 1-week trial at full rate\n\r\n- If we both agree it's a good fit, you're hired permanently\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHY WORK WITH US\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n- DIRECT HIRE: Work with us directly — no agency, no middleman\n\r\n- STABILITY: We want someone for years, not months. Our business \n\r\n  has been running for decades.\n\r\n- WEEKLY PAY: Get paid every week — no waiting around\n\r\n- INTERESTING WORK: Classic cars have one of the most passionate, \n\r\n  fun communities in the world. You'll talk to people who LOVE \n\r\n  what they do.\n\r\n- VARIETY: Our side brands keep things interesting — one minute \n\r\n  you're troubleshooting a Camaro door seal, the next you're \n\r\n  helping someone with an eBike order or a book shipment\n\r\n- REAL ADVANCEMENT: This role has a clear path to higher-paying \n\r\n  responsibilities. We promote from within and reward performance.\n\r\n- YOU MATTER: You won't be ticket #4,782. You'll be a core \n\r\n  member of a small team where your work directly impacts \n\r\n  the business.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n>>> ALL 4 ITEMS REQUIRED — Incomplete applications will NOT \n\r\n    be reviewed:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. RESUME with your relevant automotive and phone-based \n\r\n   customer service experience highlighted\n\r\n\n\r\n2. COVER LETTER that answers:\n\r\n   - What is your automotive background? (work, hobby, education)\n\r\n   - Describe a time you troubleshot a technical problem for a \n\r\n     customer over the phone — what was the issue and how did \n\r\n     you resolve it?\n\r\n   - Why does this role interest you specifically?\n\r\n   - (Remember: include the word IGNITION in your cover letter)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. AUTOMOTIVE KNOWLEDGE QUIZ — Answer these 5 questions \n\r\n   in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q1: A customer calls and says: \"I just installed new door \n\r\n       weatherstripping on my '69 Camaro and now the doors won't \n\r\n       close without slamming them. What's wrong?\"\n\r\n       Name at least 2 possible causes you would walk them \n\r\n       through.\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q2: A customer says: \"I glued my trunk seal on last night \n\r\n       and this morning it's already pulling away from the \n\r\n       channel.\" What questions would you ask to figure out \n\r\n       what went wrong?\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q3: What does it mean when we say a weatherstrip seal is \n\r\n       installed with the wrong \"orientation\"? Why does it \n\r\n       matter?\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q4: A customer needs weatherstripping for his 1970 Chevelle. \n\r\n       What information do you need from him before you can look \n\r\n       up the right parts? (List as many as you can think of.)\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q5: What does \"fitment\" mean when we're talking about car \n\r\n       parts, and why is it so important for weatherstripping \n\r\n       specifically?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. VIDEO APPLICATION (2–3 minutes max):\n\r\n   Part A: Pick any classic car (any year, any make) and tell \n\r\n   us about it — what you know about it, why you like it, or \n\r\n   an interesting fact. We want to see that you can talk about \n\r\n   cars naturally and with some passion.\n\r\n   \n\r\n   Part B: Pretend you're on the phone with a frustrated \n\r\n   customer who says: \"I installed a new roof rail seal on my \n\r\n   1967 Mustang and it's leaking when it rains. Water is \n\r\n   dripping inside right above the door. I used the adhesive \n\r\n   that was recommended but the seal just doesn't seem to be \n\r\n   sitting right in the channel. What do I do?\" \n\r\n   — Talk us through how you'd handle this call. What questions \n\r\n   would you ask? How would you troubleshoot it?\n\r\n\n\r\n   Upload to YouTube (unlisted), Google Drive, or Loom and \n\r\n   include the link.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nAPPLY POINTS: Use exactly 8 Apply Points on your application.\n\r\n========================================                ",

Our purpose is to fill the gap for Medicare-covered mental health services, making them truly affordable and accessible for one of our most vulnerable populations.\n\r\nWe act as the administrative engine for our therapists, handling the heavy lifting of credentialing, billing, and insurance so they can focus entirely on clinical work. We run a tight ship, driven by data and punctuality, to ensure the physicians who trust us with their patients receive the highest standard of care coordination.  Check out our website to learn more \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe are looking for a Marketing Automation Specialist who is more than just a HubSpot administrator. We need a technical architect who can analyze HubSpot data to find growth opportunities and use AI to build smarter, more personalized patient and provider journeys.  You will be responsible for ensuring our \"administrative engine\" runs at peak efficiency through advanced automation and data-driven insights.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nWorkflow Engineering: Build and maintain sophisticated multi-branch workflows (e.g., if a therapist is licensed in NY vs. CA, they receive different onboarding sequences).\n\r\nLead Scoring & Lifecycle Mapping: Setup and tune \"Fit Scores\" for therapists and \"Urgency Scores\" for patients to ensure the enrollment team prioritizes the right leads.\n\r\nCustom Property Management: Create and audit custom properties to ensure we are capturing specific data points (e.g., \"Medicare Part B status\" or \"Clinical Specialty\").\n\r\nDatabase Hygiene: Run weekly automated \"cleanup\" tasks to merge duplicates, fix formatting (Capitalization, Phone formats), and remove unengaged subscribers to protect our sender reputation.\n\r\nAI Content Personalization: Use AI (via HubSpot's native tools or external APIs) to generate personalized\n \"snippets\" based on a lead's specific background or location.\n\r\nAutomated Data Enrichment: Build automations (using \n) that take a new lead's\n and \"scrape\" relevant public data to pre-fill their HubSpot profile before a human ever touches it.\n\r\nTranscription & Summary: Set up AI workflows to transcribe clinical outreach calls or meetings and automatically push \"Key Takeaway\" summaries into the HubSpot contact record.\n\r\nPrompt Engineering: Create and maintain a library of \"Master Prompts\" used for campaign copy, SMS alerts, and internal documentation.\n\r\nA/B Testing Infrastructure: Set up \"Champion vs. Challenger\" tests for every major\n sequence, testing subject lines, send times, and CTA button colors.\n\r\nHigh-Conversion Assets: Build and optimize HubSpot Landing Pages and pop-up forms, ensuring they are mobile-responsive and load fast for a senior demographic.\n\r\n Deliverability: Conduct monthly audits of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records and monitor \"Postmaster\" tools to ensure 99% inbox placement.\n\r\nCustom Dashboarding: Build \"Revenue Dashboards\" that show exactly which marketing channel (Google Ads,\n, Physician Referrals) is producing the highest ROI.\n\r\nCohort Analysis: Track how long it takes a therapist to go from \"Lead\" to \"Fully Credentialed\" and identify bottlenecks in the automation funnel.\n\r\nFunnel Attribution: Set up \"First-Touch\" and \"Last-Touch\" attribution models to prove which ads are actually resulting in patient sessions.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nHubSpot Power User: You should hold HubSpot Marketing Software and Reporting certifications. Experience with HubSpot \"Operations Hub\" is a massive plus.\n\r\nAI Native: You must be able to demonstrate a workflow where you’ve used AI to solve a manual data problem or scale a personalization effort.\n\r\nThe \"Data Eye\": You don't wait for us to ask for a report; you see a dip in conversion rates and bring us a solution based on the data.\n\r\nMission Alignment: You are excited about using your technical skills to help seniors access life-changing mental health care.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Value\n\r\nReliability and consistency\n\r\nProfessional communication\n\r\nConfidence without being aggressive\n\r\nStrong follow-up skills\n\r\nAbility to hit daily call targets\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Schedule\n\r\nMonday to Friday\n\r\nBetween 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM EST (US Time)\n\r\nMust be available for 8 hours a day during these hours\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease submit your resume along with a Loom video (under 3 mins) showing:\n\r\nA HubSpot workflow you are proud of.\n\r\nAn example of how you used AI to automate a marketing task.\n\r\nWhy the Total Life mission resonates with you.
