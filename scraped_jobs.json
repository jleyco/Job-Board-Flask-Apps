Buckle up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here, you’ll be:\n\r\n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\n\r\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\n\r\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\n\r\n- Help drive our projects and tools, participate in stimulating conversations, and grow with like-minded people.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you could be working on:\n\r\n- Oversight of our fast growth projects and understanding the nuances \n\r\n- Communicate status, progress, ensuring \"nothing slips through the cracks\"\n\r\n- Build and voice your opinion on key project features\n\r\n- Communicate and help developers understand various tasks\n\r\n- Testing new features to ensure it meets project needs\n\r\n- Research, engaging customers via\n/chat, proof reading, copywriting, organizing events, etc\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll do well in this job if you:\n\r\n- Are a master at the English language and care about writing well\n\r\n- Enjoy using and learning about technology and being helpful\n\r\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\n\r\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building.\n\r\n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\n\r\n- Are attentive to details.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably shouldn’t apply if:\n\r\n- You’re “just looking for extra money.”\n\r\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work.\n\r\n- You get offended easily and take things personally.\n\r\n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\n\r\n- You get overwhelmed easily, new habits, new learnings and chat messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe interview process:\n\r\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don’t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via\n.

We've had people quit smoking on our teams with our help, lose weight, learn a new instrument, speak a new language, and more.

We actually care about your happiness.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: While we like AI, and we use it in certain circumstances, we ask that no AI be used during communication. Communication is the most important thing we do. If I don't see your natural voice from our first interaction, then you're setting an inaccurate representation of who you are and how you communicate. And when I see that change, it's going to come across as a lack of harmony in how you communicate.                ",

READ THIS FIRST — THIS IS NOT A TYPICAL CUSTOMER SERVICE JOB ??\n\r\n\n\r\nWe specialize in weatherstripping, rubber seals, and restoration parts \n\r\nfor classic and vintage American cars — Mustangs, Camaros, Chevelles, \n\r\nImpalas, C10s, and hundreds more. Our catalog includes door seals, \n\r\ntrunk seals, roof rail weatherstripping, window seals, and a rapidly \n\r\ngrowing selection of all types of classic car restoration parts — \n\r\nover 100,000 unique SKUs and counting.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur customers are restoration shops, classic car dealers, and diehard \n\r\ncar enthusiasts across the US.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen they call, they don't ask \"where's my package?\" — they ask:\n\r\n\"I installed new door seals on my '69 Camaro and now the doors are \n\r\nso hard to close I have to slam them — what's going on?\" or \"My trunk \n\r\nseal isn't sitting right in the corners and I'm getting water in the \n\r\ntrunk — did I get the wrong part?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n(We also have a few smaller side brands — eBikes, motorcycle parts, \n\r\ncar decals, hobby parts, and a publishing company — but those are only \n\r\n5-10% of your work and are simple customer service. If you can handle \n\r\nthe car parts, you can handle anything.)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have NO IDEA what a door seal bulb is or why orientation \n\r\nmatters when installing weatherstripping, this job is not for you.\n\r\nIf reading that made you curious (or excited), keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHO SHOULD APPLY (and who should NOT)\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n? APPLY if you:\n\r\n- Are a car guy/car girl — you wrench on cars, watch car builds, \n\r\n  or grew up around someone who does\n\r\n- Have worked in an auto parts store, repair shop, dealership, \n\r\n  or automotive call center\n\r\n- Can hold a real, unscripted phone conversation in English with \n\r\n  American customers for 8 hours a day — not just read a script\n\r\n- Understand what fitment means and why year/make/model matters\n\r\n- Can troubleshoot a customer's installation problem over the phone \n\r\n  using common sense, product knowledge, and the right questions\n\r\n- Actually ENJOY talking to people on the phone\n\r\n\n\r\n? DO NOT APPLY if you:\n\r\n- Have never worked with cars, car parts, or automotive customers\n\r\n- Are only comfortable on chat and\n (this role is 50%+ phone)\n\r\n- Struggle with unscripted, fast-paced English phone conversations\n\r\n- Are looking for a basic VA or data entry role\n\r\n- Don't know the difference between a disc brake and a drum brake\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n- Base: $900–$1,100 USD/month (depending on automotive experience)\n\r\n- 13th Month Pay: Yes\n\r\n- Paid Time Off: 10 days/year\n\r\n- Performance Bonus: Available after 6 months based on metrics\n\r\n- Payment: Weekly via Wise or PayPal\n\r\n\n\r\nWe pay at the top of the range for people who bring real \n\r\nautomotive knowledge. If you've worked in auto parts and are \n\r\ngreat on the phone, we'll pay for that.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nSCHEDULE\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n- Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM – 4:30 PM US Central Time\n\r\n  (That's 9:00 PM – 5:30 AM Manila Time)\n\r\n- Fixed schedule, no rotating shifts\n\r\n\n\r\n- 100% Work From Home\n\r\n- Must be based in the Philippines\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWe're a US-based company running several niche e-commerce brands. Our \n\r\nCORE business — and 90-95% of your workload — is classic and vintage \n\r\nAmerican car parts. We carry one of the deepest selections of \n\r\nweatherstripping, rubber seals, and restoration parts in the industry, \n\r\nand our catalog is expanding rapidly into all types of classic car \n\r\nparts — mechanical, electrical, trim, body, and more.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've been in this industry for decades. Our customers are restoration \n\r\nshops, classic car dealers, and everyday car enthusiasts across the US \n\r\nwho are passionate about keeping these vehicles on the road.\n\r\n\n\r\nA huge part of this role is helping customers select the right \n\r\nweatherstripping and seals for their specific car, and then \n\r\ntroubleshooting installation issues over the phone. Customers will \n\r\ncall with problems like:\n\r\n- \"I glued on my door seals and they're pulling away overnight\"\n\r\n- \"My trunk lid won't latch after I installed the new trunk seal\"\n\r\n- \"The roof rail weatherstrip won't sit right in the channel\"\n\r\n- \"Which adhesive should I be using for my door seals?\"\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need to be the person who can calmly walk them through it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWE ALSO RUN A FEW SMALLER BRANDS (5-10% of your workload):\n\r\n? eBike, motorized bike & motorcycle parts (if you know cars, \n\r\n  you can handle this)\n\r\n? Car graphic decals (same car-world customers)\n\r\n? A paranormal nonfiction publishing company\n\r\n? Hobby parts\n\r\n\n\r\nThese side brands are MUCH simpler — mostly \"where's my order?\" and \n\r\n\"how do I return this?\" type questions. No deep technical knowledge \n\r\nneeded. Think of it as a mental break between the challenging car \n\r\nparts calls.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you can handle the classic car parts work, the rest is easy.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is critical to our operation — you'll be the voice our \n\r\ncustomers hear and the person they trust for answers. Because of \n\r\nthat, our screening process is thorough. We want to make sure this \n\r\nis a great fit for both sides.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHAT A TYPICAL DAY LOOKS LIKE\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n? Check overnight\ns and tickets from customers\n\r\n? Answer inbound call: \"I need a complete weatherstrip kit for a \n\r\n  '72 Chevelle Malibu 2-door hardtop — what all comes in the kit?\"\n\r\n? Troubleshoot: \"I installed the door seals on my '68 Mustang and \n\r\n  now the doors won't close without slamming them. Is the seal \n\r\n  too thick or did I do something wrong?\"\n\r\n? Walk a customer through proper seal orientation — his trunk seal \n\r\n  is installed backwards and that's why it's not seating right\n\r\n? Help a restoration shop figure out which roof rail weatherstrip \n\r\n  they need for a '70 Chevelle — hardtop vs. convertible\n\r\n? Process a return: customer ordered the wrong trunk seal — verify \n\r\n  his year/make/model and help him get the correct one\n\r\n? Advise a first-time restorer on the right adhesive for his \n\r\n  door seals — he used silicone instead of contact cement and \n\r\n  everything is peeling off\n\r\n? Take a phone order from a repeat customer who needs window \n\r\n  seals, a firewall pad, and a set of bumper guards\n\r\n? Answer a customer\n about a paranormal book shipping date\n\r\n? Help someone pick the right decal size for their car\n\r\n? Process a return on a hobby parts order\n\r\n? Answer a basic question about an eBike battery or motorcycle part\n\r\n\n\r\nThe weatherstripping and seal calls are the challenging, rewarding \n\r\ncore of the work. The side brand questions are quick and simple — \n\r\nthey break up the day.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\nTECHNICAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT — CLASSIC CAR PARTS (90-95%):\n\r\n- Handle ~40–60 customer interactions/day (phone,\n, chat)\n\r\n- Answer inbound phone calls — order questions, fitment verification, \n\r\n  installation troubleshooting, returns\n\r\n- Help customers identify the correct weatherstripping, seals, and \n\r\n  parts using year/make/model, body style, and part numbers across \n\r\n  our 100,000+ SKU catalog\n\r\n- Troubleshoot installation issues over the phone — door seals, \n\r\n  trunk seals, roof rail weatherstripping, window seals, and a \n\r\n  growing range of all types of classic car restoration parts\n\r\n- Advise customers on proper installation techniques, adhesives, \n\r\n  surface prep, and seal orientation\n\r\n- Process returns and exchanges — determine root cause (wrong part \n\r\n  for their application, installation error, or defective product)\n\r\n- Take orders over the phone\n\r\n\n\r\nADDITIONAL BRAND SUPPORT (5-10% of volume):\n\r\n- Handle basic customer service \n, occasional phone) for our \n\r\n  other brands: eBike/motorcycle parts, car graphic decals, hobby \n\r\n  parts, and a paranormal nonfiction publishing company\n\r\n- These are straightforward order support questions — no technical \n\r\n  troubleshooting needed\n\r\n- We provide simple FAQ docs and response templates for these brands\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n???? MUST HAVE (Non-Negotiable):\n\r\n\n\r\n- AUTOMOTIVE KNOWLEDGE: You must have hands-on experience or working \n\r\n  knowledge of cars and car parts. You understand what year/make/model \n\r\n  fitment means. You know basic automotive terminology (not just from \n\r\n  Google — from experience).

This means:\n\r\n    • You can think on your feet and respond naturally — not read \n\r\n      from a script\n\r\n    • You can handle frustrated customers calmly and professionally\n\r\n    • American customers can understand you clearly without asking \n\r\n      you to repeat yourself constantly\n\r\n    • You can explain technical concepts in simple terms\n\r\n    • You've done this professionally before (call center, phone \n\r\n      support, phone sales — at least 2 years)\n\r\n\n\r\n- TROUBLESHOOTING ABILITY: When a customer says \"I installed this \n\r\n  seal and it's not right,\" you don't panic. You ask the right \n\r\n  questions: What's the year/make/model? Which seal did they install? \n\r\n  Is the bulb facing the right direction? Did they prep the surface \n\r\n  and use the right adhesive? Can they send a photo?

We're a growing company and we reward \n\r\npeople who perform.\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what growth looks like:\n\r\n- MASTER THE ROLE: Become the go-to expert our customers trust. \n\r\n  Build deep product knowledge across our catalog.\n\r\n- EARN MORE: As you prove yourself, we expand your responsibilities \n\r\n  — and your compensation grows with them.

We promote \n\r\n  from within.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're not looking for someone to fill a seat for 6 months. We want \n\r\nsomeone who wants to build a career with us — and we'll invest in \n\r\nthe right person.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nOUR HIRING PROCESS (Read This Carefully)\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role demands real automotive knowledge and real phone skills — \n\r\nnot everyone has both. Our process is designed to find the person \n\r\nwho does. If that's you, this will be easy.\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 1: APPLICATION (below)\n\r\n- Submit your resume and cover letter\n\r\n- Complete the 5-question automotive knowledge quiz (below)\n\r\n- Record and submit your video application (details below)\n\r\n- You MUST include the word IGNITION somewhere in your cover \n\r\n  letter to confirm you read this entire posting\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 2: REVIEW & WRITTEN ASSESSMENT\n\r\n- We review applications and quiz scores\n\r\n- Top candidates receive a short written assessment: a customer \n\r\n \n scenario where you must help a customer identify the \n\r\n  right seal for their car and troubleshoot an installation issue\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 3: LIVE PHONE ROLEPLAY (This Is the Real Test)\n\r\n- We will call you unannounced (within a scheduled window) \n\r\n  and roleplay a real customer call scenario:\n\r\n    ? \"Hey, I just installed new door weatherstripping on my \n\r\n      1970 Chevelle and the doors are really hard to close now. \n\r\n      I have to basically slam them shut. I followed the \n\r\n      instructions but something's not right. Can you help?\"\n\r\n- We're evaluating: Can you think on your feet? Do you ask \n\r\n  smart diagnostic questions? (Did you prep the surface? What \n\r\n  adhesive did you use? Is the seal oriented correctly? Have you \n\r\n  tried adjusting the striker?) Are you calm and professional? \n\r\n  Can we understand you clearly? Do you sound like someone our \n\r\n  customers would trust?\n\r\n\n\r\nSTEP 4: OFFER & PAID TRIAL WEEK\n\r\n- Start with a paid 1-week trial at full rate\n\r\n- If we both agree it's a good fit, you're hired permanently\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nWHY WORK WITH US\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n- DIRECT HIRE: Work with us directly — no agency, no middleman\n\r\n- STABILITY: We want someone for years, not months. Our business \n\r\n  has been running for decades.\n\r\n- WEEKLY PAY: Get paid every week — no waiting around\n\r\n- INTERESTING WORK: Classic cars have one of the most passionate, \n\r\n  fun communities in the world. You'll talk to people who LOVE \n\r\n  what they do.\n\r\n- VARIETY: Our side brands keep things interesting — one minute \n\r\n  you're troubleshooting a Camaro door seal, the next you're \n\r\n  helping someone with an eBike order or a book shipment\n\r\n- REAL ADVANCEMENT: This role has a clear path to higher-paying \n\r\n  responsibilities. We promote from within and reward performance.\n\r\n- YOU MATTER: You won't be ticket #4,782. You'll be a core \n\r\n  member of a small team where your work directly impacts \n\r\n  the business.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n========================================\n\r\n\n\r\n>>> ALL 4 ITEMS REQUIRED — Incomplete applications will NOT \n\r\n    be reviewed:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. RESUME with your relevant automotive and phone-based \n\r\n   customer service experience highlighted\n\r\n\n\r\n2. COVER LETTER that answers:\n\r\n   - What is your automotive background? (work, hobby, education)\n\r\n   - Describe a time you troubleshot a technical problem for a \n\r\n     customer over the phone — what was the issue and how did \n\r\n     you resolve it?\n\r\n   - Why does this role interest you specifically?\n\r\n   - (Remember: include the word IGNITION in your cover letter)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. AUTOMOTIVE KNOWLEDGE QUIZ — Answer these 5 questions \n\r\n   in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q1: A customer calls and says: \"I just installed new door \n\r\n       weatherstripping on my '69 Camaro and now the doors won't \n\r\n       close without slamming them. What's wrong?\"\n\r\n       Name at least 2 possible causes you would walk them \n\r\n       through.\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q2: A customer says: \"I glued my trunk seal on last night \n\r\n       and this morning it's already pulling away from the \n\r\n       channel.\" What questions would you ask to figure out \n\r\n       what went wrong?\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q3: What does it mean when we say a weatherstrip seal is \n\r\n       installed with the wrong \"orientation\"? Why does it \n\r\n       matter?\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q4: A customer needs weatherstripping for his 1970 Chevelle. \n\r\n       What information do you need from him before you can look \n\r\n       up the right parts? (List as many as you can think of.)\n\r\n\n\r\n   Q5: What does \"fitment\" mean when we're talking about car \n\r\n       parts, and why is it so important for weatherstripping \n\r\n       specifically?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. VIDEO APPLICATION (2–3 minutes max):\n\r\n   Part A: Pick any classic car (any year, any make) and tell \n\r\n   us about it — what you know about it, why you like it, or \n\r\n   an interesting fact. We want to see that you can talk about \n\r\n   cars naturally and with some passion.\n\r\n   \n\r\n   Part B: Pretend you're on the phone with a frustrated \n\r\n   customer who says: \"I installed a new roof rail seal on my \n\r\n   1967 Mustang and it's leaking when it rains. Water is \n\r\n   dripping inside right above the door. I used the adhesive \n\r\n   that was recommended but the seal just doesn't seem to be \n\r\n   sitting right in the channel. What do I do?\" \n\r\n   — Talk us through how you'd handle this call. What questions \n\r\n   would you ask? How would you troubleshoot it?\n\r\n\n\r\n   Upload to YouTube (unlisted), Google Drive, or Loom and \n\r\n   include the link.\n\r\n\n\r\n========================================\n\r\nAPPLY POINTS: Use exactly 8 Apply Points on your application.\n\r\n========================================                ",

Our purpose is to fill the gap for Medicare-covered mental health services, making them truly affordable and accessible for one of our most vulnerable populations.\n\r\nWe act as the administrative engine for our therapists, handling the heavy lifting of credentialing, billing, and insurance so they can focus entirely on clinical work.

This is a sales-driven role that requires a unique blend of \"Closing Power\" and \"Deep Empathy.\" You aren't just an order-taker; you are a consultant and advocate.\n\r\nYour primary goal is to convert inbound leads and referrals into booked clinical appointments.

    "description": "\n                    About Total Life\n\r\nTotal Life is a mission-based organization dedicated to providing therapy to older adults—a group that is often overlooked by the healthcare system. Our purpose is to fill the gap for Medicare-covered mental health services, making them truly affordable and accessible for one of our most vulnerable populations.\n\r\nWe act as the administrative engine for our therapists, handling the heavy lifting of credentialing, billing, and insurance so they can focus entirely on clinical work. We run a tight ship, driven by data and punctuality, to ensure the physicians who trust us with their patients receive the highest standard of care coordination.  Check out our website to learn more \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe are looking for a Marketing Automation Specialist who is more than just a HubSpot administrator. We need a technical architect who can analyze HubSpot data to find growth opportunities and use AI to build smarter, more personalized patient and provider journeys.  You will be responsible for ensuring our \"administrative engine\" runs at peak efficiency through advanced automation and data-driven insights.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nWorkflow Engineering: Build and maintain sophisticated multi-branch workflows (e.g., if a therapist is licensed in NY vs. CA, they receive different onboarding sequences).\n\r\nLead Scoring & Lifecycle Mapping: Setup and tune \"Fit Scores\" for therapists and \"Urgency Scores\" for patients to ensure the enrollment team prioritizes the right leads.\n\r\nCustom Property Management: Create and audit custom properties to ensure we are capturing specific data points (e.g., \"Medicare Part B status\" or \"Clinical Specialty\").\n\r\nDatabase Hygiene: Run weekly automated \"cleanup\" tasks to merge duplicates, fix formatting (Capitalization, Phone formats), and remove unengaged subscribers to protect our sender reputation.\n\r\nAI Content Personalization: Use AI (via HubSpot's native tools or external APIs) to generate personalized\n \"snippets\" based on a lead's specific background or location.\n\r\nAutomated Data Enrichment: Build automations (using \n) that take a new lead's\n and \"scrape\" relevant public data to pre-fill their HubSpot profile before a human ever touches it.\n\r\nTranscription & Summary: Set up AI workflows to transcribe clinical outreach calls or meetings and automatically push \"Key Takeaway\" summaries into the HubSpot contact record.\n\r\nPrompt Engineering: Create and maintain a library of \"Master Prompts\" used for campaign copy, SMS alerts, and internal documentation.\n\r\nA/B Testing Infrastructure: Set up \"Champion vs. Challenger\" tests for every major\n sequence, testing subject lines, send times, and CTA button colors.\n\r\nHigh-Conversion Assets: Build and optimize HubSpot Landing Pages and pop-up forms, ensuring they are mobile-responsive and load fast for a senior demographic.\n\r\n Deliverability: Conduct monthly audits of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records and monitor \"Postmaster\" tools to ensure 99% inbox placement.\n\r\nCustom Dashboarding: Build \"Revenue Dashboards\" that show exactly which marketing channel (Google Ads,\n, Physician Referrals) is producing the highest ROI.\n\r\nCohort Analysis: Track how long it takes a therapist to go from \"Lead\" to \"Fully Credentialed\" and identify bottlenecks in the automation funnel.\n\r\nFunnel Attribution: Set up \"First-Touch\" and \"Last-Touch\" attribution models to prove which ads are actually resulting in patient sessions.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nHubSpot Power User: You should hold HubSpot Marketing Software and Reporting certifications. Experience with HubSpot \"Operations Hub\" is a massive plus.\n\r\nAI Native: You must be able to demonstrate a workflow where you’ve used AI to solve a manual data problem or scale a personalization effort.\n\r\nThe \"Data Eye\": You don't wait for us to ask for a report; you see a dip in conversion rates and bring us a solution based on the data.\n\r\nMission Alignment: You are excited about using your technical skills to help seniors access life-changing mental health care.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Value\n\r\nReliability and consistency\n\r\nProfessional communication\n\r\nConfidence without being aggressive\n\r\nStrong follow-up skills\n\r\nAbility to hit daily call targets\n\r\n\n\r\nWork Schedule\n\r\nMonday to Friday\n\r\nBetween 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM EST (US Time)\n\r\nMust be available for 8 hours a day during these hours\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease submit your resume along with a Loom video (under 3 mins) showing:\n\r\nA HubSpot workflow you are proud of.\n\r\nAn example of how you used AI to automate a marketing task.\n\r\nWhy the Total Life mission resonates with you.

I'm looking for a marketer who can own the strategy and execute the day-to-day — someone who thinks proactively about how to grow a small creative services business, starts with content, and builds from there.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Own\n\r\nContent is the starting point, but this role is built to grow into a full marketing partnership. Here's what that looks like:\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Strategy & Execution\n\r\n•Develop a content strategy for LinkedIn and Instagram aligned to generating leads and building credibility\n\r\n•Create content independently — using my portfolio, past work, and context I give you — without needing constant input fro\n\r\n•Write and format posts, carousels, and captions that sound human and on-brand\n\r\n•Manage a consistent publishing cadence and track what's working\n\r\n\n\r\nMarketing Strategy (Where This Grows)\n\r\n•Proactively bring ideas: new channels, lead gen approaches,\n, referral systems — whatever makes sense for a small studio\n\r\n•Think about the full picture, not just content\n\r\n•Recommend experiments and share your reasoning\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly Collaboration\n\r\n•One weekly check-in to review what shipped, what's next, and any strategic decisions\n\r\n•Async updates between calls as needed\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'll Give You to Work With\n\r\nI want to be upfront about what you can expect fro\n:\n\r\n•Access to my portfolio and past client work — the raw material for content\n\r\n•1–2 hours of context per project or content batch — I'll explain the work, the thinking, the story behind it\n\r\n•Feedback on drafts and direction\n\r\n•A weekly call to stay aligned\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I won't do: feed you a steady stream of voice memos or raw ideas. You need to be able to generate quality content from a portfolio and occasional conversations — not wait for me to hand you everything.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Role Is For\n\r\nYou're a great fit if you:\n\r\n•Have real experience marketing a small or service-based business (not just managing social media)\n\r\n•Can build a content strategy and execute it without being micromanaged\n\r\n•Write well and can capture a brand voice from examples — AI tools are fine for support, but your writing ability matters\n\r\n•Are proactive: you bring ideas, flag problems, and move without being pushed\n\r\n•Understand that for a services business, trust and visibility drive leads — and that content is one of several levers\n\r\n•Are comfortable with a weekly check-in model and managing your own time between calls\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't the right role if you:\n\r\n•Need constant direction or frequent input to produce work\n\r\n•Think in terms of posts and engagement metrics only\n\r\n•Rely on AI to do most of the thinking and writing\n\r\n•Prefer execution over strategy\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDetails\n\r\n•Hours: 10–15 hrs/week to start, can grow to 20+\n\r\n•Pay: $350–$450/mo USD to start, with growth potential tied to results\n\r\n•Timezone: Weekly call in my late afternoon / your morning (you manage your own schedule beyond that)\n\r\n•Platforms to start: LinkedIn, Instagram\n\r\n•Long-term: scope and pay grow as results build — including other marketing channels\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease answer the following questions. Applications without real answers will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\n1.Describe a time you built or owned a content or marketing strategy for a small or service-based business. What did you actually do, and what happened?\n\r\n2.How do you approach creating content when the business owner isn't giving you much raw material to work with?\n\r\n3.Share examples of content you've created or strategized — especially for service businesses or creative work.\n\r\n4.What marketing channels or strategies beyond content would you explore for a small design studio, and why?\n\r\n5.What tools do you use to manage content strategy and track performance?\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional but appreciated: A short Loom (2–3 min) walking me through how you'd approach the first 30 days.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term role with real growth potential. If you're a marketer who wants ownership and the chance to build something — I'd love to hear from you.                ",

We need a cold\n specialist who has personally built and managed campaigns sending 100,000+\ns per month and knows how to do it without landing in spam.\n\r\nThis is a highly technical, results-driven role. We are not looking for someone who has \"used Instantly before.\" We are looking for someone who can architect an entire cold\n infrastructure from scratch, manage domain health, write converting sequences, and optimize based on data.\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\n1. Infrastructure Build & Management (40% of your time)\n\r\nPurchase, configure, and warm up sending domains (Google Workspace or Microsoft 365)\n\r\nSet up and maintain a rotating mailbox system across multiple domains to maximize deliverability\n\r\nConfigure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records correctly for every domain\n\r\nMonitor domain health and sender reputation daily — replace burned domains immediately\n\r\nManage the Instantly.ai account including campaign settings, sending limits, and warm-up schedules\n\r\n2. List Building & Enrichment with Clay AI (30% of your time)\n\r\nBuild targeted lead lists of luxury automotive dealership owners, GMs, and decision-makers across all 50 US states\n\r\nUse Clay AI to enrich each contact with relevant data (dealership name, brands carried, location, recent activity)\n\r\nUse Clay's AI column feature to write hyper-personalized first lines for every contact based on enriched data\n\r\nMaintain clean, deduplicated lists — no bounces, no duplicates, no unsubscribes re-entered\n\r\nSource additional data from Apollo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, or other tools as needed\n\r\n3. Sequence Writing & Optimization (30% of your time)\n\r\nWrite or refine 3-5 step\n sequences with strong subject lines, personalized openers, and clear CTAs\n\r\nA/B test subject lines, CTAs, and\n length systematically\n\r\nMonitor open rates, reply rates, positive reply rates, and bounce rates daily\n\r\nOptimize sequences based on data — kill what is not working, scale what is\n\r\nSend weekly performance reports to your manager with clear metrics and recommendations\n\r\nTarget Metrics You Are Expected to Hit\n\r\nOpen rate: 40%+\n\r\nReply rate: 3-8%\n\r\nBounce rate: under 3%\n\r\nSpam complaint rate: under 0.1%\n\r\nVolume: 50,000–150,000\ns/month at scale\n\r\nTools You Must Know\n\r\nClay AI, Instantly.ai, Google Workspace, Apollo (or equivalent), Notion or Google Sheets for reporting\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nMinimum 2 years of hands-on cold\n experience at high volume (100k+\ns/month)\n\r\nProven experience with Clay AI for list enrichment and personalization — this is non-negotiable\n\r\nDeep understanding of\n deliverability: SPF, DKIM, DMARC, domain warm-up, mailbox rotation\n\r\nExperience managing 20+ sending domains simultaneously\n\r\nStrong analytical mindset — you make decisions based on data, not gut feeling\n\r\nExcellent written English for sequence copywriting\n\r\nBonus: experience in automotive, real estate, or B2B SaaS outreach\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\nSend the following:\n\r\nScreenshots or a brief description of the largest cold\n campaign you have personally managed (volume, industry, results)\n\r\nYour process for setting up a new domain from purchase to first send — walk me through it step by step\n\r\nYour experience with Clay AI specifically — what enrichment columns have you built and what personalization have you generated with it?\n\r\nYour hourly rate and availability\n\r\nVague applications will be ignored. We need specifics. Show us you know what you are doing.\n\r\nA Note on This Hire\n\r\nThis person is arguably your most important hire after the deal closes. The cold\n machine is what signs dealers, and signed dealers are what triggers your 20% revenue share. A mediocre cold\n person sends 10,000\ns and gets 50 replies. A great one sends 100,000 and gets 5,000 replies. The difference in dealer signups — and your income — is enormous.\n\r\nIf your current developer is flaking, this job post is the replacement. The right person for this role can handle the Instantly infrastructure setup that Andrew was supposed to do, plus run the ongoing campaigns, for a fraction of the $4,000 one-time fee. Worth considering.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Right off the bat, we're paying a much higher rate than normal for a VA. Which means we are looking for someone in the top 10% of VA's. Please don't apply if you can't perform at the level we are expecting.\n\r\n\n\r\nI own a pickleball coaching company in the US.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) help people get introduced to pickleball through our beginner clinics.\n\r\n2) help people who already play pickleball get better at pickleball through lessons\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for an assistant to do the tasks I am currently doing so I can free up my time to coach more lessons instead of doing admin tasks. As well as for me to get to spend more time to train and be with my family.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn order to do well at this job you need:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Attention to detail. If you aren't good at this, please don't apply. We are providing a higher than normal rate for a VA to get someone who is very good at this job. Attention to details are essential. If you aren't good at this, don't apply. It will be obvious.\n\r\n2) A great attitude. I know people say this all the time but you will need a great, can-do attitude. Otherwise, this won't be a good fit.\n\r\n3) Strong work ethic. If you're not a hard worker, again, it will be obvious.\n\r\n4) Energetic. You will be talking to and helping customers a lot over the phone. If they can't feel your energy and excitement to help them, you're not a good fit.\n\r\n5) Professional. This is a business. You need to be professional and represent the company well when speaking with customers.\n\r\n6) Punctual. If you're not on time, keeping up with tasks, calling people, etc. this is definitely not the job for you. And this isn't the job to learn this skill on. If you're not punctual there are so many tasks that will expose this. And it won't be good for either of us and will waste both of our time.\n\r\n7) Highly organized with excellent time management skills.\n\r\n8) Speak Native English. You don't need to be a native of the US. But you need to speak English so well that you could be. When someone calls in they need to not be able to tell you're not from the US. We want them to feel like you actually live in the US and can help them. You need to know American vernacular, slang, etc. and be able to speak the language flawlessly. Again, if you can't do this it will be noticeable.\n\r\n9) Write English well. You'll also have to text a lot. So written skills are a must as well.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou would be responsible for doing the things I'm doing currently:\n\r\n\n\r\nSales\n\r\nWe have people call in and text in a lot about pickleball lessons. We run a lot of marketing including ads. You need to be able to speak to these leads on the phone and help them. When you’re doing sales for us, you’re really just being helpful. But you do need to know how to overcome objections, talk about benefits, build rapport, etc. You also need to know how to set follow ups in CRM’s and follow up with them on time, when appropriate, etc.\n\r\n\n\r\nPost Lesson Management\n\r\nWhen our coaches give a lesson, there’s post lesson work to do like scheduling the next lesson for the students who are taking another lesson, following up with the students who aren’t taking the next lesson and see about getting them into another lesson soon, follow up with the ones who weren’t sure about taking the next lesson and talk to them about it, and then find other students in our CRM wanting to take a lesson that could fill the spots.\n\r\nYou’ll also need to help do the admin tasks of the post lesson work like scheduling the next lesson in our scheduling software, scheduling a court with the facility, checking the students paid, tagging me to do payment deposits for the next lesson, and other things.\n\r\n\n\r\nStudent Management\n\r\nThere’s also other things you’ll need to do to make sure the business is running smooth like answering calls from existing students and helping them with anything they need, students cancelling and rescheduling, them asking when their next lesson is, etc.\n\r\n\n\r\nMarketing\n\r\nFrom time to time I will need help with marketing. Including\n management, blog post management (I’ll probably write most of these, I just need you to collect some data for me to put in there, so you’ll be doing research), newsletter management eventually, etc.\n\r\n\n\r\nReporting\n\r\nI’ll also have you do some financial reporting as well most likely. But I’ll set you up for success on how to do this.\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd anything else\n\r\nThere will be a lot of other things I’m sure that come up. Your job is just to help me make this thing run.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're basically a VA/Sales/Scheduling/Customer Support/Marketing/General Tasks/Rock Star.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're a suped up front desk person that does it all with a can-do attitude that supports me as the owner and our coaches in critical tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThings you need to know:\n\r\n- We are going to ask you to learn pickleball. The more you know and have experienced pickleball the more passionate, helpful, and equipped you are to help us run this business. Yes, this means you are going to get involved in pickleball where you live and we will pay you to do so. You’re also going to be watching pickleball a lot during your down time. Again, we want you to immerse yourself in the game. And you’ll need to be watching videos and reading articles as well. Whenever there are no critical tasks and there’s a bit of free time in your work day, you’ll be using that to dive more into pickleball so you can really understand our business and be ablle to help our customers more fully.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours:\n\r\n- Mon – Fri: 9am – 5pm EST\n\r\n- Sat: On call 9am – 5pm (just need to answer phone calls to help players if they have an issue, no need to do other tasks)\n\r\n- Sun: Off\n\r\n\n\r\n60 day trial period – there will be a 60 day trial period. This will be to assess if you are truly a good fit for the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuestions for you to answer in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Monthly fee you require for full time (keep in mind, if people have the same skillsets we will obviously choose the person with the more competitive rate. So, even though we are paying quite high, price yourself at what you feel comfortable making so you're competitive)?\n\r\n\n\r\n2. At this rate you mentioned above, am I your only client?\n\r\n\n\r\n3. At this rate you mentioned above, are you able to work 40 hours a week at a minimum and likely more?\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Are you good with being on call on Saturday (work should be somewhat rare, it would only be tasks that need to be done that Saturday and can't be done on Monday, like if a student gets locked out of the building and calls in for help. Leads, post lesson, management, marketing, etc. can all be done Mon - Fri. On call is really just emergencies only. We want you to have work life balance.)?\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Are you open to a few test days (you would get paid) to see if we work well together?\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Do you play pickleball, tennis, ping pong or any other sports?\n\r\n\n\r\n7. Why do you think you'd be a good fit for this project?\n\r\n\n\r\n8. What makes you think you’d be good at the sales portion of the job?\n\r\n\n\r\n9. Have you used Slack before?\n\r\n\n\r\n10. What kind of software do you use that makes being a VA essential in your opinion?\n\r\n\n\r\n11. Please provide a 2 minute or longer video on:\n\r\n\n\r\na) Your history using English\n\r\nb) Any other information you think would be helpful\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd that’s it!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe look forward to your applications.

This will begin on a per-video basis and can grow into a larger monthly arrangement over time if we’re a strong fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nI am not looking for a quick one-off freelancer. I am looking for someone who would eventually prefer steady collaboration with one person rather than constantly searching for the next gig.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Projects You’ll Be Editing\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary focus:\n\r\n\n\r\nSeek Consciousness — breathwork, focus, personal growth, and discussions around psychedelics and expanded awareness. If you are not comfortable working with this subject matter, this will not be a good fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional variety:\n\r\n\n\r\nLeviticus Tattoo — art, culture, studio life\n\r\nMinneapolis HiFi — high-end audio, music immersion, events\n\r\n\n\r\nThese add creative variety and different tones of content.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Expected Volume\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting around 10–20 videos per month including:\n\r\n\n\r\n• YouTube long-form videos\n\r\n• Podcast edits\n\r\n• Clipping shorts and reels from longer content\n\r\n• Educational and talking-head style videos\n\r\n\n\r\nVolume will grow over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Editing Style\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking for someone who can handle intentional, message-driven content with strong pacing and emotional awareness. Clean cuts, thoughtful timing, and professional polish are important.\n\r\n\n\r\nHeavy effects are not necessary. Subtle enhancements, light motion graphics, visual aids, and tasteful creative additions that support the message are welcome.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you also have YouTube thumbnail experience, please mention that and include samples.\n\r\n\n\r\n### What I Value\n\r\n\n\r\n• Reliability\n\r\n• Clear communication\n\r\n• Positive attitude\n\r\n• Good heart\n\r\n• Openness to growth\n\r\n• Comfortable communicating via Zoom,\n, and messaging\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus points if you are personally interested in meditation, mindfulness, or spiritual growth. This role can be an opportunity to deepen your own understanding while helping create meaningful content.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Optional: AI Tools Experience\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have experience using AI tools to improve workflow (for example ChatGPT, Descript, Runway, ElevenLabs, transcription tools, caption tools, or YouTube optimization tools), please briefly explain how you use them in your editing process.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not required, but openness to learning and using tools that improve efficiency is a plus.\n\r\n\n\r\n### Selection Process\n\r\n\n\r\nI will select a few of the strongest candidates and pay them to edit one or two sample videos. From there, I will choose the best long-term fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis will start a little bit smaller and grow with both of us.  As I create more content and we figure out how to increase our reach and bandwidth.  \n\r\n\n\r\nI'm a very zen and chill person and I am an artist as well which helps both in my creative work and my interactions with coworkers.\n\r\n\n\r\n### When Applying\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. 3–5 YouTube videos you have edited\n\r\n2. How you charge (per video, hourly, etc.)\n\r\n3. Your typical rate\n\r\n4. Whether you are open to growing into a larger ongoing role\n\r\n5. If you read this fully, include the word “clarity” in your response\n\r\n\n\r\nI am looking to build something meaningful and consistent over time. If that aligns with you, I’d love to hear from you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Job Description:\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe're a blockchain/DeFi company running production infrastructure that's bleeding money unnecessarily. Our AWS bill is sitting at $4,500/month – and we know it shouldn't be anywhere near that. We need someone who can come in, audit the whole setup, and actually fix it. Not just give us a report that sits in a folder.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've already been through a few candidates who talked a big game but couldn't execute. We're done with that. If you're the type who needs handholding or can't work independently, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Actually Do\n\r\n- Audit our entire AWS infrastructure and identify exactly where we're wasting money (we expect significant savings)\n\r\n- Optimize our Kubernetes clusters – right-size nodes, fix resource requests/limits, implement autoscaling that actually works\n\r\n- Implement cost controls: Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, spot instances where appropriate, and cleanup of orphaned resources\n\r\n- Set up monitoring and alerts so costs don't creep back up without us knowing\n\r\n- Document everything you do so the team can maintain it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n- 3+ years hands-on Kubernetes experience in production environments – EKS specifically preferred\n\r\n- Deep AWS knowledge: EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor\n\r\n- Proven track record of actually reducing AWS costs (be ready to share numbers/percentages)\n\r\n- Strong scripting skills (Python, Bash) for automation\n\r\n- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation (Terraform preferred)\n\r\n- Self-starter who can take ownership and execute without constant oversight\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n!!!!CRITICAL: This Role Requires Surgical Precision\n\r\nThis is production infrastructure running live systems. Think of this like surgery – one wrong move can take everything down.\n\r\n- NO cowboy moves. You don't delete, modify, or remove anything without a clear plan first.\n\r\n- Every change must be planned out, documented, and confirmed with the CEO before execution.\n\r\n- Extreme attention to detail. You double-check and triple-check before touching anything.\n\r\n- If you're not 100% sure what something does, you ask first. You don't assume.\n\r\n- Methodical execution only. We value careful and correct over fast and reckless.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong Plus\n\r\n- Experience with blockchain/Web3 infrastructure\n\r\n- Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, or KEDA experience\n\r\n-  AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer)\n\r\n- Experience with FinOps tools (Kubecost, CloudHealth, \n)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Need In Your Application\n\r\nDon't send a generic application. We will ignore it. Include:\n\r\n- Specific examples of AWS cost optimization you've done – what was the setup, what did you change, what % did you save?\n\r\n- Your Kubernetes experience – cluster sizes you've managed, scaling strategies you've implemented\n\r\n- Your availability and timezone (we need someone who can overlap with US business hours for some calls)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Structure\n\r\n- $20-25/hour based on experience and proven results\n\r\n- 20 hours/week to start – potential for more hours for the right person\n\r\n- Fully remote\n\r\n- Initial project: Comprehensive audit + implementation plan with clear cost reduction targets\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're someone who can actually deliver results and not just talk about them – we want to hear from you. Show us what you've done.                ",
