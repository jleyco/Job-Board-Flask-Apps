From firefighters, to law firms, to suppliers sending life-saving food to kids dying of malnutrition, the code you write will help make the world a better place.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur team is made up of people who want to do the best work of their life.

We are human beings before employees and we love to bring out the best in each other.\n\r\n\n\r\nNow, ready to learn more about this opening? Buckle up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here, you’ll be:\n\r\n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\n\r\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\n\r\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\n\r\n- Help expand our codebase and tools, participate in code reviews, and grow with your fellow developers.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll do well in this job if you:\n\r\n- Have a strong background in Python and understand HTML, CSS and Javascript enough to be dangerous.\n\r\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\n\r\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building.\n\r\n- Are familiar with common things we deal with as developers: Git, SQLAlchemy, building and engaging with APIs, linters, etc.\n\r\n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\n\r\n- Are attentive to details.\n\r\n- Have 3+ years of Python development experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably shouldn’t apply if:\n\r\n- You’re “just looking for extra money.”\n\r\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work.\n\r\n- You get offended easily and take things personally.\n\r\n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\n\r\n- You get overwhelmed easily with new code, new habits, new learnings and chat messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe interview process:\n\r\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don’t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via\n. (With lots of questions, sprinkled with a few voice notes)\n\r\n- You may be able to speak with a developer or two on our team to see how they like the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here:\n\r\n- You’ll get 13th month salary, Filipino holidays, unlimited time off (we don’t count sick days), a normal working day schedule (no night shifts, although an early start is preferred for time overlap) with some flexibility, a week off during the holidays in December, and the opportunity to grow and become your best self.\n\r\n\n\r\nA little more about us:\n\r\n- We’ve been in business for a decade+. Our teams are remote (mostly in the Philippines). Our longest standing tea\nmber has been with us for over 13+ years. We've had people quit smoking on our teams with our help, lose weight, learn a new instrument, speak a new language, and more. We all love what we do.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to begin\n\r\n- Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to send us an\n with 3 questions you have about this role. If you’re currently in a full-time role and are looking for something new, we’re open to a transition window. We actually care about your happiness.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: While we like AI, and we use it in certain circumstances, we ask that no AI be used during communication. Communication is the most important thing we do. If I don't see your natural voice from our first interaction, then you're setting an inaccurate representation of who you are and how you communicate. And when I see that change, it's going to come across as a lack of harmony in how you communicate.                ",

Buckle up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here, you’ll be: \n\r\n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\n\r\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\n\r\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\n\r\n- Help expand our codebase and tools, participate in code reviews, and grow with your fellow developers. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll do well in this job if you:\n\r\n- Have a strong background in Python and understand HTML, CSS and Javascript enough to be dangerous.\n\r\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\n\r\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building. \n\r\n- Are familiar with common things we deal with as developers: Git, SQLAlchemy, building and engaging with APIs, linters, etc. \n\r\n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\n\r\n- Are attentive to details.\n\r\n- Have 3+ years of Python development experience. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably shouldn’t apply if:\n\r\n- You’re “just looking for extra money.”\n\r\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work. \n\r\n- You get offended easily and take things personally. \n\r\n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\n\r\n- You get overwhelmed easily with new code, new habits, new learnings and chat messages. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe interview process:\n\r\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don’t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via\n. (With lots of questions, sprinkled with a few voice notes)\n\r\n- You may be able to speak with a developer or two on our team to see how they like the role. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here:\n\r\n- You’ll get 13th month salary, Filipino holidays, unlimited time off (we don’t count sick days), a normal working day schedule (no night shifts, although an early start is preferred for time overlap) with some flexibility, a week off during the holidays in December, and the opportunity to grow and become your best self. \n\r\n\n\r\nA little more about us:\n\r\n- We’ve been in business for a decade+. Our teams are remote (mostly in the Philippines). Our longest standing tea\nmber has been with us for over 13+ years. We've had people quit smoking on our teams with our help, lose weight, learn a new instrument, speak a new language, and more. We all love what we do. \n\r\n\n\r\nHow to begin\n\r\n- Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to send us an\n with 3 questions you have about this role. If you’re currently in a full-time role and are looking for something new, we’re open to a transition window. We actually care about your happiness.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: While we like AI, and we use it in certain circumstances, we ask that no AI be used during communication. Communication is the most important thing we do. If I don't see your natural voice from our first interaction, then you're setting an inaccurate representation of who you are and how you communicate. And when I see that change, it's going to come across as a lack of harmony in how you communicate.                ",

As launch volume increases (3–4/month), this role improves speed, accuracy, and execution quality across PDPs, promotions, and site updates.\n\r\nYou’ll act as the execution right-hand to the Marketing Manager — owning backend setup, QA, CRO execution, and cross-functional coordination, while surfacing risks early and keeping work moving forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nRole Scorecard & Outcomes\n\r\nE-commerce Execution & Site Ownership\n\r\nShopify backend is clean, accurate, and fully maintained.

OOS risks, restocks, and back-in-stock opportunities are proactively flagged and supported through site updates and campaign readiness.\n\r\nOperational Reliability\n\r\nReporting, inventory visibility, and promo-related site updates are accurate, timely, and dependable.\n\r\nCross-Functional Coordination\n\r\nDesigners, copywriters, inventory, and agencies receive clear briefs, timelines, and follow-ups. Work progresses without repeated intervention from the Marketing Manager.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nE-commerce & Website Execution\n\r\nBuild and manage PDPs in the Shopify backend (SKUs, variants, pricing, bundles, collections).\n\r\nImplement PDP copy (from Copywriter) and visual assets (from Designer).\n\r\nExecute homepage, collection, and promotional site updates.\n\r\nMaintain site hygiene: broken links, formatting issues, outdated content, and UX friction.\n\r\nQA the site prior to launches to ensure accuracy, functionality, and readiness.\n\r\nIntegrate SEO content into the website.\n\r\nConversion Rate Optimization (CRO)\n\r\nSupport CRO initiatives including layout adjustments, upsells, trust elements, and merchandising improvements.\n\r\nExecute approved A/B tests and experiments; document changes and results.\n\r\nProduct Launch Execution\n\r\nCoordinate product launches and promotions based on the marketing calendar.\n\r\nOwn backend launch setup end-to-end (products, pricing, promos, collections, inventory sync).\n\r\nConduct basic competitor pricing analysis and margin checks when required.\n\r\nSupport post-launch performance summaries and insights.\n\r\nMarketing Operations\n\r\nMaintain daily, weekly, and monthly scorecards.\n\r\nMonitor inventory levels relevant to marketing execution (OOS, low stock, restocks, incoming inventory).\n\r\nPartner with Inventory and Operations teams to stay aligned on availability, timing, and constraints.\n\r\nSupport back-in-stock, relaunch, and inventory-driven campaigns through site and launch readiness.\n\r\nCoordinate with internal teams and external agencies to keep timelines on track.\n\r\nFlag execution risks, blockers, or dependencies early — with proposed solutions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWays of Working & Mindset\n\r\nOwnership mindset: Takes responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks.\n\r\nBias toward action: Moves work forward with imperfect information.\n\r\nCommercially aware: Understands how inventory, timing, and execution impact revenue.\n\r\nDetail-obsessed but pragmatic: High accuracy without paralysis.\n\r\nSolution-oriented: Comes with options, not just problems.\n\r\nCalm under pressure: Handles launch changes without noise.\n\r\nRight-hand mentality: Thinks one step ahead to reduce load on the Marketing Manager.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCore Competencies\n\r\nStrong Shopify and e-commerce backend fluency.\n\r\nHigh attention to detail and execution accuracy.\n\r\nCRO and merchandising fundamentals.\n\r\nInventory awareness for e-commerce and lifecycle marketing.\n\r\nClear written communication and coordination skills.\n\r\nComfort working with performance data and reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nCandidate Must-Haves\n\r\nProven experience executing e-commerce updates in Shopify or similar platforms.\n\r\nStrong analytical literacy using GA4, Shopify Analytics, and/or heat map tools (Hotjar, Clarity).\n\r\nAbility to manage multiple execution tasks with speed and accuracy.\n\r\nStrong problem-solving instincts and independent judgment.\n\r\nExcellent QA discipline, especially around launches, pricing, promos, and inventory-driven updates.\n\r\n\n\r\nNice-to-Haves\n\r\nExperience in DTC or high-SKU e-commerce environments with frequent launches.\n\r\nExposure to CRO frameworks beyond basic A/B testing.\n\r\nExperience coordinating with paid media, lifecycle, or\n teams.\n\r\nFamiliarity with strength training, home gym equipment, or enthusiast-driven brands.\n\r\n\n\r\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY: To apply send your CV/resume with answers to the screening questions below: \n\r\nYou'll own Shopify execution so launches, promos, and site updates happen fast and correctly — without the Marketing Manager babysitting every detail. That means you'll work with teams here to ensure everything is accurate.\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Tell me about a Shopify/E-commerce launch (ex. major site update, product launch, promo launch etc.).What was your day-by-day execution plan, who are the teams involved, how do you ensure all teams are on top of things? Please break them down and share situations where you had to step in. \n\r\n\n\r\n2) Before launching something high-impact, what is your personal QA checklist? What are 5 things that commonly break that others forget to check?\n\r\n\n\r\n3) Tell me about a time you had to set something up in a system where accuracy was critical before it went live (e.g., product setup, pricing update, bulk edits, system configuration).

We are hiring 3 Senior Engineers for a 3-month contract with the opportunity to convert to a full-time salaried role. During this period, we offer flexible work commitment options to ensure the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will own the core product infrastructure. You will architect and build the engines that drive our main products: a LinkedIn automation bot and a real-time AI voice calling system (Linked).\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive ownership role. You will not just be writing backend workers; you will be building the full feature set—from the React UI where users configure campaigns, to the backend engines that execute them. You will be the technical owner of our automation logic, security posture, and infrastructure.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Engineering Challenge\n\r\nOur platform is currently a large Node.js application. Your mission is to evolve this into a scalable system while shipping critical features. You will need to decouple heavy background workers (browser automation, audio processing) from the main API server without breaking the user experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nLinkedIn Automation Engine: We have the scheduling logic, but we need the execution layer. You will architect a robust worker system using Puppeteer/Playwright that manages headless browsers, handles session persistence, rotates proxies, and mimics human behavior to prevent account bans.\n\r\n\n\r\nVoice AI Infrastructure: Maintain and optimize our WebSocket bridge between Twilio and ElevenLabs. You will debug race conditions, improve call outcome detection (distinguishing voi\ns from gatekeepers), and ensure real-time latency remains low.\n\r\n\n\r\nCampaign Orchestration &\n: Maintain the complex logic that weaves calls,\ns, and LinkedIn actions into sequences. This includes managing\n OAuth integrations (Gmail/Outlook), token refreshing, and deliverability logic.\n\r\n\n\r\nSecurity & Compliance: Own the application security posture. Implement CSRF protection, secure webhook handling, and lead the technical side of security audits (specifically Google CASA verification).\n\r\n\n\r\nFull-Stack Implementation: You are not just a backend dev. When you build a new automation feature, you will also build the React components and settings pages that allow customers to use it.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Stack\n\r\nBackend: Node.js (TypeScript), Express\n\r\nFrontend: React, Tailwind\n\r\nData: PostgreSQL (Supabase), Redis\n\r\nAutomation: Puppeteer / Playwright, BullMQ\n\r\nVoice: Twilio Media Streams, ElevenLabs WebSocket API\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are Looking For\n\r\nSystems-Focused: You understand the difference between writing an endpoint and building a distributed system. You know how to manage memory leaks in long-running processes.\n\r\n\n\r\nAutomation Experience: You have built scrapers, bots, or testing frameworks in production. You understand rate limiting, fingerprinting, and anti-detection strategies.\n\r\n\n\r\nSecurity Mindset: You write secure code by default. You are comfortable handling OAuth 2.0 flows, session management, and sensitive customer data.\n\r\n\n\r\nProduct-Capable: You can touch the frontend. You don't need to be a designer, but you must be able to wire up the UI for the complex backend features you build.\n\r\n\n\r\nAI Native Tooling: You are proficient and efficient using AI coding tools like Cursor, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot to accelerate development. You view these as essential tools for velocity, not shortcuts for understanding.\n\r\n\n\r\nLLM Interest: While we currently use APIs, we have a roadmap to experiment with self-hosted 7B+ parameter models. You are interested in eventually moving down the stack to optimize inference and deploy open-source models for real-time voice.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nPlease share your CV and a portfolio of relevant work (GitHub links, technical write-ups, or case studies). Please specifically mention your experience with browser automation and background queues.                ",

We've been in business since 2008 and work with companies like Tinder, College Board, Illumina, and NOV. We have 500+ engineers and serve clients across banking, healthcare, e-commerce, education, energy, and technology.\n\r\nWe're growing our US market presence and need a sharp, hungry inside sales rep to help us build pipeline and book qualified meetings with enterprise decision-makers.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is NOT a virtual assistant role. This is NOT a call center job. This is a real B2B sales position where you'll be prospecting into US enterprises, having real business conversations, and directly contributing to company revenue. If you've sold B2B tech services or SaaS to US companies before, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Outbound Prospecting (60% of your time)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Research and identify target accounts: VP/Director-level decision-makers in Engineering, QA, DevOps, SRE, and IT Operations at US mid-market and enterprise companies\n\r\n- Build prospect lists using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Apollo, ZoomInfo, or similar tools\n\r\n- Write personalized cold\ns and LinkedIn messages (not spray-and-pray templates)\n\r\n- Make cold calls and follow-up calls to prospects\n\r\n- Execute multi-touch outbound sequences \n + LinkedIn + phone)\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Pipeline Management (20%)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Qualify inbound leads from our website (\n)\n\r\n- Manage your pipeline in HubSpot CRM - keep it clean and updated daily\n\r\n- Book discovery calls and demos for our account executives and technical team\n\r\n- Track all activities, conversations, and outcomes\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Research and Strategy (20%)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Research target industries to understand their performance testing pain points\n\r\n- Monitor trigger events: new product launches, site outages, migration announcements, funding rounds\n\r\n- Contribute ideas to improve our outreach messaging and targeting\n\r\n- Provide market feedback on what prospects are saying\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Selling\n\r\nPFLB helps companies make sure their software doesn't crash, slow down, or fail when lots of people use it at the same time. We offer:\n\r\n\n\r\n- Performance testing services - our team of engineers runs load and stress tests on websites, apps, APIs, and enterprise systems\n\r\n- PFLB Platform - our AI-powered load testing platform that companies can use themselves\n\r\n- Managed performance engineering - ongoing performance monitoring, optimization, and SRE support\n\r\n\n\r\nOur typical clients are companies that can't afford downtime: banks processing transactions, e-commerce sites during Black Friday, healthcare platforms during open enrollment, energy utilities during storm events, EdTech platforms during exam periods.\n\r\nDeal sizes range from $5,000 for a single project to $200,000+ for annual managed services contracts. Your job is to open doors and book meetings - our technical team handles the demos and closing.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\nMust-have:\n\r\n\n\r\n- 2+ years of B2B outbound sales experience (SDR, BDR, or inside sales role)\n\r\n- Experience selling to US-based companies (you understand US business culture)\n\r\n- Excellent spoken and written English - you can hold a natural conversation with a US executive without them noticing you're reading from a script\n\r\n- Experience with CRM tools (HubSpot preferred, Salesforce also fine)\n\r\n- Experience with LinkedIn for prospecting\n\r\n- Comfortable making cold calls (not just\ns)\n\r\n- Reliable high-speed internet + backup connection\n\r\n- Willing to work US time zone hours (EST or CST overlap, typically 9pm-6am PH time)\n\r\n- Own laptop/computer with webcam and headset\n\r\n\n\r\nNice-to-have (not required, but will make you stand out):\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience selling IT services, SaaS, DevOps tools, or technical consulting\n\r\n- Familiarity with sales tools: ZoomInfo, Apollo, Outreach, Salesloft, Lemlist, or similar\n\r\n- Understanding of software development concepts (you don't need to be technical, but knowing what QA, load testing, DevOps, or cloud infrastructure means is a big plus)\n\r\n- Experience with LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n\r\n- Track record of meeting or exceeding quota\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation and Benefits\n\r\n\n\r\n- Base salary: PHP 70,000 - 90,000/month depending on experience\n\r\n- Performance bonuses: Additional PHP 5,000 - 10,000 per qualified meeting booked that converts to opportunity (uncapped)\n\r\n- Paid time off: 14 days per year\n\r\n- Growth: This is a ground-floor opportunity. As we grow the US sales team, high performers will move into senior sales or account executive roles with higher comp\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT just click \"Apply\" and send a generic message. Applications that don't follow these instructions will be ignored.\n\r\nTo apply, please send me a message with the following:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: \"PFLB Sales - [Your First Name]\"\n\r\nIn your message, answer these three questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What is the most complex B2B product or service you've sold, and who were you selling to? (2-3 sentences)\n\r\n2. Describe your best month in sales - what did you do differently that month? (2-3 sentences)\n\r\n3. Why does this role interest you specifically? (1-2 sentences)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAttach your resume (PDF preferred)\n\r\nRecord a 2-minute Loom video (free at \n) where you pitch PFLB's services to me as if I'm a VP of Engineering at an e-commerce company worried about Black Friday traffic. Don't worry about getting every detail right - I want to hear how you communicate, think on your feet, and handle a sales conversation. Paste the Loom link in your message.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you cannot follow these four steps, this role is probably not a good fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Hiring Process\n\r\n\n\r\n- Application review (1-2 days)\n\r\n- Async screening (the Loom video above)\n\r\n- Live video interview with me - includes a mock cold call exercise (30 minutes)\n\r\n- Paid trial task: I'll give you 10 real target companies and ask you to build outreach sequences for 3 of them. This is paid work ($50 USD) regardless of whether we hire you.\n\r\n- Offer and 90-day trial period\n\r\n\n\r\nWe move fast. If you're a fit, you could be starting within 2 weeks.\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm looking for someone who's genuinely excited about sales, not just looking for any remote job. If you love the hunt, enjoy talking to people, and want to be part of building something, I'd love to hear from you.                ",

    "description": "\n                    About the Project:\n\r\nWe are looking for a skilled Full Stack Developer to jump into an existing, production-grade SaaS application (\"Your Safety Partners Portal\"). The app is a multi-tenant safety management platform with a focus on Training/LMS features.\n\r\nWe have an existing codebase and a fresh set of designs. We need you to bridge the gap: implement the new UI designs pixel-perfectly and modify the existing logic to support these changes.\n\r\nThe Tech Stack (Must Have):\n\r\nThis is NOT a beginner role. You must be comfortable with:\n\r\n• Next.js 15 (App Router): We use Server Actions extensively.\n\r\n• TypeScript (Strict): No any types. We prioritize type safety.\n\r\n• Styling: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and Shadcn UI.\n\r\n• Database: PostgreSQL with Kysely query builder (connected via Neon).\n\r\n• State: React Context & React Hook Form (with Zod validation).\n\r\nWhat You Will Do:\n\r\n1. UI/UX Implementation: Take our new designs (Figma/Mockups) and implement them into the existing Next.js application, focusing specifically on the Training & Course Management modules.\n\r\n2. Logic Modification: Refactor existing Server Actions and Components to match the new workflows. You won't be rewriting the whole app, but you will be modifying how Courses, Modules (SCORM/Documents), and User Assignments work.\n\r\n3. Clean Code: We follow a \"Minimal Abstraction\" philosophy. We prefer readable, locatable code over over-engineered patterns. You must be able to read existing code (Middleware, RBAC, etc.) and follow the established patterns.\n\r\n4. Bug Fixing: identifying and fixing UI regressions or logic errors introduced during the redesign.\n\r\nNice to Have (Bonus):\n\r\n• Experience with SCORM or LMS platforms.\n\r\n• Experience with Replicache or Local-First sync strategies.\n\r\n• Experience with file uploads to AWS S3 via presigned URLs.\n\r\nWho You Are:\n\r\n• You pay attention to detail. If the design has 16px padding, you don't make it 20px.\n\r\n• You are comfortable working in a large, existing codebase without breaking unrelated features.\n\r\n• You communicate clearly and flag issues early.\n\r\nHow to Apply:\n\r\nTo ensure you have read this post, please do the following:\n\r\n1.

These percentages are estimates and you can expect your day-to-day to shift and evolve as the business grows and as you take ownership. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Customer Experience\n\r\n• Provide\n/chat-based support for our customers across our channels (Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale)\n\r\n• Answer order and product questions, resolve issues promptly, and ensure customers feel heard and supported\n\r\n• Support wholesale partners with order updates, invoicing, and coordination\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Order Management & Platform Coordination\n\r\n• Manage, monitor, and troubleshoot orders across Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale channels\n\r\n• Troubleshoot and resolve shipping or fulfillment issues with partners and customers\n\r\n• Maintain accurate product listings, inventory data, and logistics information across platforms\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Executive & Admin Support\n\r\n• Manage founder and team inboxes, schedule meetings, and organize internal documentation\n\r\n• Assist with travel bookings, meeting preparation, and note-taking\n\r\n• Support small projects by tracking timelines, managing tasks, and ensuring follow-through\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Special Projects & Company Operations\n\r\n• Conduct research projects to support decision-making (tools, systems, competitors)\n\r\n• Support lead generation efforts through identifying new wholesale prospects, brand partners, or influencers\n\r\n• Support planning and execution of events, expos, or marketing campaigns — manage timelines, logistics, and tasks\n\r\n• Document and maintain SOPs for operational clarity and training\n\r\n• Test and troubleshoot web pages, workflows, or customer journeys to ensure quality and functionality\n\r\n• Take ownership of ad hoc “figure it out” tasks — we’ll guide you, but we value initiative and independent problem-solving mindset\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be trained on all platforms and tools, and we’ll support your learning — but we’re looking for someone who’s excited to take initiative and build systems along the way. This role evolves — as you grow, so will your responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / REQUIRED SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE:\n\r\nWe value curiosity, reliability, and the ability to take ownership. If you enjoy figuring things out, learning on the job, and taking initiative, you’ll thrive here. This role is not a fit if you need constant direction or struggle to manage your own time.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have experience:\n\r\n• 2+ years of experience in a customer service or operations support role \n/chat-based)\n\r\n• 1+ years experience in eCommerce environments (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)\n\r\n• Fluent in written and spoken English\n\r\n\n\r\nKey traits:\n\r\n• Strong detail orientation, organizational, and time-management skills — you’re detail-obsessed and on top of things\n\r\n• Proactive problem-solver — you take initiative, do the research, and follow through\n\r\n• Able to work independently, ask questions when needed, and communicate clearly\n\r\n• Comfortable with constructive feedback and direct, respectful communication\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional but a big plus:\n\r\n• Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus\n\r\n• Experience with executive assistant work \n/calendar/travel management)\n\r\n• Experience improving or documenting processes (SOPs)\n\r\n• Experience at a startup or small business where you wore multiple hats\n\r\n• “Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY, WORKING HOURS, HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nIf this description seems like it’s too intimidating for you, this position is probably not for you. However, if you’re still here reading and this sounds exciting for you, we’d love to meet you!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe full time monthly salary will be $\nbased on your skills and level of relevant experience. Being a member of our team has other benefits including up to 16 days of paid time off per year.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our interview process extremely quick and efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.
