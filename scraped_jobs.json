You should be able to work confidently with HubSpot’s workflow builder, custom code actions (using JavaScript in HubSpot Functions where needed), and have practical knowledge of APIs and webhooks to integrate HubSpot with third-party systems. A working understanding of HubSpot user permissions, data model design, and how HubSpot interacts with external tools in a typical B2B stack is important.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should also be comfortable configuring and working with commonly used HubSpot Sales and Marketing tools, including forms, CTAs, sequences,\n templates, and basic reporting.

Experience with custom integrations (for example, connecting HubSpot with other CRMs, ticketing tools, or data platforms) is a plus, as long as you understand the underlying API behavior and are not fully dependent on prebuilt connectors.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe value reliability, clear communication, and consistency. This role is best suited for someone who takes ownership of delivery, estimates effort realistically, communicates clearly when there are blockers, and does not require close supervision to move work forward.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe contractor will use their own tools and methods and will not be entitled to employee benefits.

We partner with a diverse range of businesses to launch and manage impactful sales and marketing campaigns. In addition to our client work, we are constantly innovating and launching our own suite of internal products. We thrive in a fast-paced environment and are looking for an energetic team player to grow with us.\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are seeking a highly adaptable and results-driven Sales Development Representative (SDR) to join our sales team. This is not a typical SDR role where you master one product and one pitch. You will be a key player in driving growth across multiple fronts, working on a variety of short-term client campaigns and our own internal product launches.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ideal candidate is a master of context-switching, a quick learner, and a communication expert who is genuinely excited by the challenge of representing different brands and products. One week you might be booking demos for a client’s SaaS platform; the next, you could be generating leads for our new internal software. Your ability to quickly absorb new information, adapt your pitch, and maintain high performance across diverse campaigns is critical to success in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You’ll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Master the Pivot**: Seamlessly switch between multiple client and internal campaigns, quickly learning new products, services, value propositions, and target audiences.\n\r\n- **Multi-Channel Outreach**: Execute high-volume outbound prospecting for various campaigns through cold calling, personalized\n sequences, and LinkedIn outreach.\n\r\n- **Lead Qualification & Booking**: Engage with potential customers to understand their needs, qualify them as sales opportunities, and book high-quality meetings for Account Executives.\n\r\n- **Campaign Management**: Manage and report on the pipeline for several campaigns simultaneously, ensuring you meet or exceed targets for each.\n\r\n- **Client-Facing Communication**: Represent client brands with the utmost professionalism, providing a best-in-class first impression.\n\r\n- **Internal Collaboration**: Work closely with our internal product and marketing teams to develop and refine outreach strategies for our own products.\n\r\n- **CRM Discipline**: Meticulously track all activities, update lead statuses, and manage data with high accuracy across our CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce).\n\r\n- **Feedback Loop**: Provide valuable feedback from the front lines to help our clients and internal teams refine their messaging and product strategies.\n\r\n\n\r\n## You’re a Fit If You…\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Thrive on Variety**: You are bored by monotony and energized by the challenge of learning and pitching new things constantly.\n\r\n- **Are a Quick Study**: You can rapidly understand new business models, technical products, and buyer personas and translate them into compelling outreach.\n\r\n- **Have Flawless Communication Skills**: You possess perfect, C2-level English (both written and verbal) and can articulate value propositions clearly and concisely.\n\r\n- **Are a Master of Organization**: You can juggle multiple projects, pipelines, and priorities without letting anything slip through the cracks.\n\r\n- **Are Resilient & Coachable**: You view objections as opportunities, take feedback in stride, and are always looking for ways to improve your craft.\n\r\n- **Are a Proactive Problem-Solver**: You don’t wait for instructions; you take initiative to find answers and drive results.\n\r\n\n\r\n## Requirements\n\r\n\n\r\n- 2+ years of proven success in a B2B Sales Development or Inside Sales role.\n\r\n- Demonstrable experience with high-volume cold calling and\n outreach.\n\r\n- Perfect (C2) written and verbal English communication skills.\n\r\n- Proficiency with modern CRM software (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot) and sales engagement tools (e.g., Outreach, Salesloft, \n).\n\r\n- A quiet, professional home office setup with a reliable, high-speed internet connection.\n\r\n- Must be comfortable being on camera for internal meetings and potential client-facing interactions.\n\r\n\n\r\n## Bonus Points\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience working in a marketing or sales agency environment.\n\r\n- Experience with a wide range of industries (e.g., SaaS, E-commerce, Professional Services).\n\r\n- Familiarity with cold\n platforms (e.g., Instantly.ai, Smartlead).

We are looking for an experienced\n\r\noffice manager to become the backbone of our business systems.\n\r\nThis is not a virtual assistant position. This is a leadership role where you will own critical\n\r\nbusiness systems, manage a team of virtual teammates in the Philippines, and be directly\n\r\nresponsible for the accuracy and integrity of our entire operation. You will report directly to our\n\r\nCOO and have significant authority and autonomy.\n\r\nWe pay $10-$12/hour because we expect excellence. If you are looking for easy work, this is\n\r\nnot the role for you. If you want to be challenged, grow your skills, and have real impact on a\n\r\ngrowing US company, keep reading.\n\r\nWhat You Will Own\n\r\nMaster Data Integrity (Your #1 Priority)\n\r\nOur central job tracking system is the heartbeat of our business. You will own it completely.\n\r\n• Audit the master ledger daily. Every job status, every payment, every permit must be\n\r\naccurate and current.\n\r\n• Identify discrepancies before they become problems. Chase down missing information\n\r\nrelentlessly.\n\r\n• If the data is wrong, it is your responsibility. No excuses. You find the error, you fix it, you\n\r\nprevent it from happening again.\n\r\nTeam Management\n\r\n• Manage a team of virtual teammates in the Philippines who handle production data\n\r\nentry, process tasks, and customer service.\n\r\n• Conduct daily check-ins and run tea\netings. Assign tasks. Review work quality. Hold\n\r\npeople accountable when work is incomplete or incorrect.\n\r\n• You are not their friend. You are their manager. When someone misses a deadline or\n\r\nmakes repeated errors, you address it directly.\n\r\nCollections Calls\n\r\nWhen customers owe us money and standard follow-ups have not worked, you make the call.\n\r\n• You must be comfortable having firm, professional conversations about money with\n\r\nAmerican homeowners.\n\r\n• Some customers will be difficult. Some will make excuses. You stay calm, stay firm, and\n\r\nget results.\n\r\n• This is not optional. If you are uncomfortable asking for money, do not apply.\n\r\nPermits & Scheduling\n\r\n• Manage permit applications and follow-ups with US municipalities.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Navigate tricky permit situations. Some cities are slow, some have unusual\n\r\nrequirements. You figure it out.\n\r\n• Coordinate production scheduling to ensure jobs are completed efficiently.\n\r\nProcess Enforcement\n\r\n• Audit job folders for completeness: photos, signed documents, permits, payment\n\r\nconfirmations.\n\r\n• When something is missing, you hold the responsible party accountable. This includes\n\r\nUS-based field staff who may push back on you.\n\r\n• You are the process police. Every step in our workflow must be completed correctly,\n\r\nevery time.\n\r\nYour Growth Path\n\r\nMonths 1-2: Master the production data systems. Get the master ledger to 100?curacy.\n\r\nLearn our permit processes. Establish authority with your team.\n\r\nMonths 2-4: Take full ownership of permits, scheduling, and collections. Develop and improve\n\r\nour systems. Become the person everyone relies on for operational accuracy.\n\r\nMonths 4+: Take on management of our customer service team. Continue growing your scope\n\r\nas the company grows. This role has significant upward potential for the right person.\n\r\nRequirements (Non-Negotiable)\n\r\n• Proven experience managing other remote tea\nmbers. We will ask for specific\n\r\nexamples. If you have never managed people, this role is not for you.\n\r\n• Excellent English communication (C2 level, native-like fluency). You will speak\n\r\ndirectly with American customers, municipalities, and staff daily. Your English must be\n\r\nflawless and confident.\n\r\n• Assertive communication style. You must be comfortable pushing back, asking hard\n\r\nquestions, and holding people accountable. You will manage Americans who may\n\r\noutrank you on paper. You cannot be timid.\n\r\n• Obsessive attention to detail. You notice when numbers do not add up. You catch the\n\r\ntypo. You follow the thread until it is resolved. Mistakes frustrate you.\n\r\n• High intelligence and problem-solving ability. You will encounter situations with no\n\r\nclear playbook. You need to think critically, figure things out, and make good decisions\n\r\nindependently.\n\r\n• Extreme ownership mentality. When something goes wrong in your area, you own it.\n\r\nYou do not make excuses. You do not blame others. You fix it and prevent it from\n\r\nhappening again.\n\r\nStrongly Preferred\n\r\n• Experience in US construction, home services, logistics, or operations administration\n\r\n• Experience with collections or accounts receivable\n\r\n• Familiarity with US municipal permit processes\n\r\n• Experience managing data integrity in spreadsheets or CRM systems\n\r\nWork Hours & Compensation\n\r\n• Schedule: Full-time, approximately 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. You\n\r\nwill run tea\netings and coordinate with US-based staff throughout the day.\n\r\n• Compensation: $10-$12/hour USD, based on experience and demonstrated capability.\n\r\n\n\r\n• Growth: Compensation reviews as you take on expanded responsibilities.\n\r\nWhy This Role Matters\n\r\nOur company is at a critical growth point. The accuracy of our data directly impacts our cash\n\r\nflow, our customer satisfaction, and our ability to scale. You will not be a cog in a machine. You\n\r\nwill be a key leader helping us build systems that actually work. If you want a role where your\n\r\nwork has visible, immediate impact, this is it.\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend your resume and a written response (not a video) that addresses the following. Be specific\n\r\nand give real examples:\n\r\n1. Management experience: Describe a time you held a tea\nmber accountable for\n\r\npoor work or missed deadlines. What happened? How did you handle it? What was the\n\r\nresult?\n\r\n2. Difficult conversation: Tell me about a time you had to have a hard conversation with\n\r\nsomeone who did not want to hear what you had to say. How did you approach it?\n\r\n3. Data and systems: Describe your experience managing data accuracy in a fast-paced\n\r\nenvironment. What systems have you used? How did you ensure nothing fell through the\n\r\ncracks?\n\r\n4. Why this role: Why are you interested in this specific position? What about it appeals to\n\r\nyou?\n\r\nApplications without thoughtful written responses will not be considered.\n\r\nDo Not Apply If...\n\r\n• You have never managed other people before\n\r\n• You are uncomfortable with confrontation or holding people accountable\n\r\n• You prefer to avoid phone calls, especially difficult ones\n\r\n• You tend to let small errors slide rather than fixing them immediately\n\r\n• You are looking for easy, repetitive work\n\r\nIf you made it this far and you meet these requirements, we want to hear from you.

    "description": "\n                    ## About The Project\n\r\n\n\r\nI run a research-based health website focused on kidney disease and anti-aging interventions — \n. The site is built around a published book covering 68 scientifically-validated natural therapies, supported by a blog with articles grounded in medical research (PubMed, nephrology journals, etc.).\n\r\nI'm a full-time professional based in Sydney, Australia, with limited availability. I need someone who can own the operational side of this website completely — not someone who waits for instructions on every small task.\n\r\nThis is a long-term role. If you're good and the site grows (which is the plan), your hours and pay grow with it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nIn the first 30 days, your priorities will be:\n\r\n\n\r\nInstalling and configuring WordPress plugins (Google Analytics 4 via Site Kit, Search Console, RankMath SEO, ConvertKit, Pretty Links, Hotjar, UpdraftPlus)\n\r\nSetting up\n opt-in forms and a welcome\n sequence in ConvertKit/MailerLite\n\r\nAuditing all existing blog articles against a Google EEAT compliance checklist I'll provide\n\r\nRevising articles using Claude AI (I'll give you a prompt template) to improve citations, author authority signals, and trustworthiness markers\n\r\nSetting up affiliate links for health supplements (iHerb, Amazon Associates) using Pretty Links\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter the first month, your ongoing responsibilities will include:\n\r\n\n\r\nPublishing 2-3 SEO-optimised blog articles per week (you research and write drafts; I review and approve)\n\r\nBuilding and managing a monthly keyword content calendar using Ubersuggest or similar\n\r\nManaging\n broadcasts and the monthly community newsletter draft\n\r\nMonitoring GA4 and Search Console and sending me a brief weekly summary (what's ranking, what's growing, what needs attention)\n\r\nMaintaining affiliate link accuracy and adding new affiliate opportunities as they arise\n\r\nLight Canva work for blog images and product mockups\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're The Right Person If:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have at least 2 years of hands-on WordPress experience (not just \"I've used it\" — you know plugins, themes, settings, and can troubleshoot basic issues without Googling for 3 hours)\n\r\nYou have done SEO content work before and understand what keyword research, meta descriptions, and internal linking actually mean in practice\n\r\nYou're comfortable using AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to assist with content drafting and revision — you don't need to be an expert, but you can't be afraid of it\n\r\nYou have worked on a health, wellness, or medical-adjacent website before (not required, but a significant advantage)\n\r\nYou can work with minimal supervision — I'll give you clear deliverables and deadlines, but I won't micromanage daily tasks\n\r\nYou're based in the Philippines and available for a short weekly check-in call (30 min, Sydney time — flexible on exact timing)\n\r\nYour written English is excellent. Health content requires precision — vague or sloppy writing won't work here\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're NOT The Right Person If:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need constant hand-holding or daily check-ins to stay on track\n\r\nYou've never managed affiliate links or worked with monetised content before\n\r\nYou apply to every job on this platform without reading the post (see application instructions below)\n\r\nYou're looking for short-term or project-only work\n\r\n\n\r\nHours & Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\nStart: 20 hours/week\n\r\nRate: $5 USD/hour depending on experience (open to negotiation for the right candidate)\n\r\nPaid weekly via Wise or Payoneer\n\r\nHours can increase to 30-40/week within 3-6 months as the project scales\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You'll Be Using\n\r\nWordPress, RankMath, ConvertKit or MailerLite, Pretty Links, Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, Ubersuggest, Canva, Claude AI, Gumroad, Google Docs/Sheets, Notion (for task tracking)\n\r\n\n\r\nHow To Apply\n\r\nTo filter serious applicants: begin your application message with the phrase \"Kidney Health VA\" followed by your answer to this question:\n\r\n\"Describe one specific thing you would check or fix on a health blog article to improve its Google EEAT score. Be specific — not general.\"\n\r\nThen include:\n\r\n\n\r\nA brief overview of your most relevant experience (2-3 paragraphs)\n\r\nLinks to any WordPress sites you've worked on (even if you just managed them — I'm not looking for designers)\n\r\nYour availability and timezone\n\r\nYour motivation (or story) for the role\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that don't follow these instructions will not be read. This isn't being harsh — it's how I know you pay attention to detail, which is the most important quality for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nOne More Thing\n\r\nThis website is about a topic that matters — helping people with serious kidney disease find affordable, evidence-based options outside the standard clinical pathway. I want someone who finds that work meaningful, not just someone filling hours. If that resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you. If anyone of your family or friends is suffering from chronic diseases, and if you are going deep into clinical research to help him or her, include that in the \"Your motivation (or story) for the role\" section.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: Applications must be handwritten — AI-generated responses will be filtered out. The role itself heavily involves AI tools including Claude, so comfort with AI is required                ",
