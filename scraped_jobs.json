Do not apply if you use AI-generated templates. Do not apply if you cannot do advanced audio mixing.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Channel Style I am wanting to create \"No Speaking\" Solo Camping & Bushcraft videos. There is NO music and NO voiceover. The storytelling is purely visual and based on natural audio atmosphere (ASMR).\n\r\n\n\r\nYou MUST study these 3 channels before applying. We want this EXACT style:\n\r\n\n\r\nAntonio Off-Grid\n\r\n\n\r\nVolyn Bushcraft\n\r\n\n\r\nGo4x4\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Goal: High Engagement & Storytelling Even though the video is relaxing, it must not be boring.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Hook\" (First 10 Seconds): You must create a high-energy teaser intro. Quick cuts of the best \nnts (fire lighting, steak sizzling, drone shots) to grab the viewer immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nVisual Variety: Keep the viewer engaged with different angles. Do not linger on a single static shot for too long unless it is visually stunning.\n\r\n\n\r\nChronological Story: The video must flow logically in order: Travel -> Arrival -> Setup -> Cooking -> Night -> Morning -> Pack up.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nSound Design (The #1 Priority):\n\r\n\n\r\nSince there is no music, you must master the audio mixing.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Drone/B-Roll\" Rule: If we use a drone shot or a B-roll clip with no audio, you must add natural sound effects (wind, flowing water, birds, footsteps). The video must never be completely silent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliverables Per Project:\n\r\n\n\r\n1x Long Form Video: 15–20 Minutes (4K, Color Corrected).\n\r\n\n\r\n3x Viral Reels/Shorts: You must extract 3 engaging vertical clips (9:16) from the main footage to drive traffic to the main video.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Application Process (Important) We are looking for quality and reliability.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe will review your portfolio.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Trial: If selected, you will be asked to edit one video as a final test.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: This trial edit will be UNPAID as part of the final application process. This is to prove you can handle the specific pacing and sound design requirements.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf your trial is successful, you will be hired immediately to work alongside me long-term.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or Final Cut.\n\r\n\n\r\nFast internet (for downloading large 4K files).\n\r\n\n\r\nAccess to a Sound Effects library (for wind, rain, nature sounds).\n\r\n\n\r\nAttention to Detail: You read the instructions and understand exactly what we need.\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you very much. I look forward to hearing from you soon                ",

    "description": "\n                    First things first…\n\r\nThis is a 100% remote position. The current annual salary range for this position is $30,000 - $55,000 USD + bonus opportunity.\n\r\nThis position will support our portfolio of internal companies that span across different industries (including mortgage compliance to HR/bookkeeping). However, the first year will be highly focused on our company: MQMR.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Do\n\r\nYou are the \"Apprentice\" to the Systems Team. While the Lead AI Engineer designs the architecture, you are responsible for the foundational coding, testing, and maintenance that keeps the system running.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a growth role for a developer who wants to specialize in AI and Automation. You will not be designing complex architecture on Day 1; you will be writing Python scripts, testing automation workflows, cleaning data for AI models, and ensuring our code is bug-free before it goes live.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\nA. Automation & Scripting Support \n\r\n- Python & Scripting: Write and maintain basic Python scripts to support data extraction and automation logic. You must be comfortable writing code to solve specific, small-scope problems.\n\r\n- Workflow Support: Assist in building and debugging workflows in N8n or other automation tools. You implement the \"If/Then\" logic defined by the Lead Engineer.\n\r\n- Maintenance: Monitor existing automations. If a script fails or an API connection breaks, you are the first responder to investigate and patch it.\n\r\n\n\r\nB. Quality Assurance (QA) & Testing\n\r\n- The \"Tester\": Before any AI agent or automation is released to the business, you break it. You run test cases to ensure the logic holds up under different scenarios.\n\r\n- Logic Check: You review workflows to ensure they match the requirements provided by the Coordinator/Director before they are deployed.\n\r\n- Bug Tracking: You document errors clearly and work with the Lead Engineer to resolve them.\n\r\n\n\r\nC. Data Hygiene & Preparation \n\r\n- Data Formatting: You prepare, format, and clean data sets (CSV/Excel) to be ingested by our AI agents or HubSpot. You ensure dates, names, and integers are formatted correctly.\n\r\n- HubSpot Data: Assist in bulk data updates, list cleaning, and maintaining the integrity of our CRM database so our automation tools can read it accurately.\n\r\n\n\r\nD. Web & Technical Support \n\r\n- Basic Web Updates: Handle minor updates to the company website using HTML/CSS (fixing typos, updating images, or changing layout elements).\n\r\n- Tier 1 Support: Handle basic technical requests from the team to free up the Lead Engineer for high-level architectural work.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Will Make You Successful\n\r\n- Coding Literacy: You must have working knowledge of Python. Familiarity with HTML/CSS and basic SQL is expected.\n\r\n- Experience: 2-5 years in Junior Development, Data Analysis, or a related technical field (fresh Computer Science graduates welcome).\n\r\n- Tech Stack:\n\r\n          - Code: Python (Must have), HTML/CSS (Basic).\n\r\n          - Tools: Familiarity with Git/GitHub is a plus.\n\r\n          - Data: Strong operational Excel skills (VLOOKUPs, data formatting) or basic SQL.\n\r\n- Logic Mindset: You enjoy solving puzzles and can follow data flow logic (e.g., \"If this happens, then that happens\").\n\r\n- Coachability: You are eager to learn. You take feedback well and want to be molded into a high-level AI Engineer over the next 1–2 years.\n\r\n- Attention to Detail: You spot the missing comma in the code or the wrong date format in the spreadsheet before anyone else does.\n\r\n- Language: C1/C2 English proficiency.\n\r\n\n\r\nAtomus Core Value Alignment\n\r\n- Commit to Quality: You have an \"acute attention to detail\" and spot the missing comma in the code or the wrong date format in the spreadsheet before anyone else does.\n\r\n- Create Solutions: When a data flow logic isn't performing, you don't just report it; you fix it.\n\r\n- Collaborate as One: You work seamlessly with our Sales and Operations teams.\n\r\n- Cultivate Raving Fans: You don’t just deliver a solution; you create an experience that empowers your colleagues\n\r\n- Climb Higher: You are committed to constant professional and personal improvement.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We Do At Atomus\n\r\nAtomus — from the Latin word for “atoms,” the basic building blocks of the universe. At Atomus Partners, we’re the building blocks for growth. We step in as trusted partners to help small and mid-size businesses strengthen and scale their most critical functions — HR, Talent Acquisition & Finance/Accounting — so leaders can stay focused on what they do best: growing their business.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don’t just solve today’s challenges — we help our clients see beyond today, laying the foundation for long-term success and sustainable growth.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join the Atomus Team?\n\r\nAre you a code-literate puzzle solver ready to bridge the gap between foundational scripts and complex AI automation while building your career as a world-class developer? \n\r\n\n\r\nIf so, join us! Working at Atomus means living and breathing our core values: Commit to Quality, Create Solutions, Collaborate as One, Cultivate Raving Fans, and Climb Higher. \n\r\n\n\r\nHere, you’ll do more than just “work a job” — you’ll solve meaningful problems, stretch your skills, and grow faster than you ever thought possible. One year at Atomus is the equivalent of three to five years elsewhere. We’re looking for people who are hungry to build, learn, and make an impact — not just clock in and out.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are more than just a firm; we are a community that has mastered virtual culture. We’ve always been 100% remote, maintaining a 70+ Employee Net Promoter Score. We host monthly virtual activities and wellness challenges. We offer a holistic environment with flexible PTO where we don't count days, and annual performance bonuses.\n\r\n If you share our values and are excited by the challenge of bridging the gap between risk and compliance, we’d love to hear from you.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf interested, please apply through our Paylocity job link: \n                ",

Your job is to manage, schedule, publish,\n\r\ntrack, and optimize across 8 platforms daily. This is an execution role, not a writing role.\n\r\n\n\r\nPosition Details\n\r\n\n\r\nDetail Information\n\r\nJob Title Social Media & Campaign Manager\n\r\nCompany Invest Like A Millionaire (\n)\n\r\nIndustry Fintech / Trading Technology / SaaS\n\r\nLocation 100% Remote — Philippines-based\n\r\nHours Full-time (40 hrs/week) — Must overlap 9 AM–12 PM U.S. Eastern Time\n\r\nStart Date ASAP (Target: March 1, 2026)\n\r\nReports To Founder & CEO (Pranav Sahai, Princeton, NJ, USA)\n\r\nCompensation $800–$1,200 USD/month (based on experience), with performance bonuses\n\r\nContract Long-term contractor, paid monthly via Wise, PayPal, or similar\n\r\nGrowth Path Marketing Manager ? Head of Marketing Operations (within 12 months)\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Company\n\r\nInvest Like A Millionaire (ILAM) is a trading technology platform launching April 1, 2026. We combine two proprietary products — ILAM Scanner (systematic buy/sell signals using a 5-criteria methodology) and Sentinel Alpha (24/7 portfolio risk monitoring) — into a unified Trading Command Center for experienced traders and high-net-worth investors.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur founder, Pranav Sahai, is a Top 1% U.S. mortgage broker with 20+ years in finance, featured in the Wall Street Journal and Scotsman Guide. ILAM is backed by real financial expertise, not hype.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a lean, high-velocity team. You will be employee #1 on the marketing side, working directly with the CEO daily. This is a ground-floor opportunity with a company targeting rapid growth.\n\r\n?\n\r\nHOW THIS ROLE WORKS\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nTHE AI-POWERED WORKFLOW\n\r\nWe use Claude (AI) to write one master content piece per day.\n\r\nClaude repurposes that single piece into 8 platform-specific versions.\n\r\nYOUR JOB: Take those 8 versions, format them, schedule them, publish them,\n\r\ntrack their performance, and report results. Every single day.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Daily Workflow\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1: Receive Daily Content Package (Morning)\n\r\nEach morning, the CEO or AI assistant will provide you with a content package containing one master post repurposed into 8 platform-specific versions. Your Google Sheet editorial calendar will tell you what topic is scheduled for that day.\n\r\nStep 2: Format & Customize for Each Platform\n\r\nTake each platform version and apply the correct formatting, hashtags, image/video attachments, link placement, and character limits. Add any platform-specific touches (e.g., LinkedIn has no links in body, Instagram needs image,\n needs thread format).\n\r\nStep 3: Schedule or Publish\n\r\nPublish posts at optimal times for each platform using scheduling tools (Buffer, Hootsuite, or native schedulers). Some posts will be immediate; others will be scheduled 1-3 days ahead.\n\r\nStep 4: Engage & Monitor\n\r\nMonitor comments, replies, and DMs across all 8 platforms. Respond to engagement within 2 hours during your working hours. Flag high-value leads or important messages to the CEO immediately via Slack.\n\r\nStep 5: Track & Report\n\r\nUpdate the master Google Sheets tracking dashboard daily.

If you want to be early in a team where your work has visible impact (and where you’ll learn quickly), you’ll fit in here.\n\r\n\n\r\nA) About the role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe operate two established pet businesses:\n\r\n\n\r\n(i) a Shopify e-commerce platform, and\n\r\n(ii) a veterinary clinic.\n\r\n\n\r\nBoth have 10+ years of customer history and a deep base of warm customers. Our growth strategy is simple: aggressively retarget warm audiences (not broad discovery). A large portion of our customer database is WhatsApp-first (phone numbers, limited\n).\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to turn our customer lists (WhatsApp /\n exports) + website visitors into a disciplined Meta \n engine across\n, Instagram, and WhatsApp that drives measurable purchases and voucher redemptions.\n\r\n\n\r\nB) Work arrangement: \n\r\nWork From Office (Philippines).

Build behavior-based audiences (7/14/30 day visitors, ViewContent/ATC/IC, etc.) + exclusions (purchasers, recent redeemers)\n\r\niv. Set up clean retargeting structure: sequencing, windows, frequency control, suppression\n\r\nv. Run Dynamic Product Ads / catalog retargeting where appropriate (Shopify)\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Tracking & measurement (critical)\n\r\ni. Ensure Meta Pixel + CAPI works properly on Shopify (event QA: ViewContent / AddToCart / InitiateCheckout / Purchase)\n\r\nii. Enforce UTM discipline for all WhatsApp/email links and paid ads\n\r\niii. Maintain a simple weekly performance report (spend, purchases, ROAS/MER as applicable, CPA, top audiences/creatives, key learnings, next actions)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. What we are NOT looking for\n\r\ni. Awareness/discovery campaign focus\n\r\nii. “Growth hacker” generalist\n\r\niii. SEO/content role\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a performance + tracking role focused on warm audiences and retargeting.\n\r\n\n\r\nD) Requirements (must-have)\n\r\n\n\r\ni. 2+ years running Meta retargeting for e-commerce (Shopify preferred)\n\r\nii.

You'll manage 6-figure monthly ad budgets, work directly with our Marketing Manager, and drive measurable business results for entrepreneurs building market-leading businesses.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY THIS ROLE IS DIFFERENT\n\r\n\n\r\nScale Real Businesses with Proven Systems\n\r\nYou're not just \"running ads\" - you're the engine behind scaling coaching businesses that have already generated 5M+. Your campaigns will drive leads for high?ticket programs, serving clients across Singapore, Malaysia, USA, Europe and beyond. You'll see the direct impact of your work in business transformations, not just vanity metrics.\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild an International-Standard Portfolio\n\r\nWorking with a Singapore-based company serving global clients means your portfolio will showcase international-standard campaigns. You'll manage budgets most Filipino media buyers never touch (5 to 6 figures monthly), gain experience with high-ticket funnels, and build case studies that position you as a premium ads specialist. This experience is gold for your career growth.\n\r\n\n\r\nLearn from Million-Dollar Businesses\n\r\nDirect exposure to a 7-figure founder’s marketing strategies and systems that have generated $5M+ in results. You're not just executing - you're learning business building, funnel optimization, and scaling strategies from founders who practice what they preach. We'll train you on our methodologies, AI tools, and optimization frameworks.\n\r\n\n\r\nClear Career Progression with Real Salary Growth\n\r\nWe promote from within based on results, not tenure. Proven path: Media Buyer ? Senior Ads Strategist ? Ads Director. Typical timeframe: 12-18 months for strong performers with 20-30% salary increases. As Inner World Training scales (our goal is 10X growth over next 3 years), you'll grow faster than traditional employment.\n\r\n\n\r\nWork with a Talented Creative Team\n\r\nYou won't be alone trying to make bad creatives work. We're hiring a dedicated Creative Specialist (10-20 new creatives weekly) so you have fresh ad variations to test constantly. Your job is strategy, optimization, and scaling - not begging for new ads. This is how professional media buying should work.\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE ROLE: BECOME THE ADS STRATEGIST, NOT JUST THE BUTTON-PUSHER\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're not just a Media Buyer executing campaigns - you're the Ads Strategist and Scaling Expert for Inner World Training' client portfolio, making data-driven decisions that directly impact business growth and contribute to our track record of $5M+.\n\r\n\n\r\nEvery campaign you manage serves real entrepreneurs trying to become market leaders in competitive industries. You'll work closely with our Marketing Manager to optimize the entire funnel - from lead generation to workshop applications to mastermind inquiries - using systematic testing, strategic scaling, and performance analysis.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour role is critical: replace an agency that ran the same 5 static ads for months without proper optimization. We need someone who understands that scaling requires constant creative testing, audience expansion, and data-informed decision-making.\n\r\n\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITIES: WHAT YOU'LL DO DAILY\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Function: Campaign Management & Optimization (60-70% of time)\n\r\n\n\r\n- Manage\n Ads campaigns with monthly ad spend scaling from 30K to 100K+ for coaching/consulting funnels (webinar registrations, workshop applications, mastermind inquiries)\n\r\n- Execute systematic testing strategy: 20% of budget on testing new audiences, creatives, and angles; 80% on scaling winning combinations using ABO, CBO, and advanced\n settings\n\r\n- Optimize campaigns daily based on KPI metrics (CPL, CPA, conversion rates, ROI) - adjust budgets, pause underperformers, scale winners, troubleshoot when CPLs exceed targets\n\r\n- Analyze performance data to identify trends, opportunities, and problems - translate numbers into actionable insights for Marketing Manager and the team\n\r\n- Collaborate with Creative Specialist on ad brief requirements - specify what angles, hooks, and formats to test based on performance data (you'll receive 10-20 new creatives weekly to test)\n\r\n\n\r\nStrategic Function: Scaling & Growth (20-30% of time)\n\r\n- Develop scaling strategies for winning campaigns - know when to use horizontal scaling (new ad sets), vertical scaling (budget increases), or campaign duplication based on account performance\n\r\n- Conduct audience research to identify new targeting opportunities - lookalikes, interest stacking, competitor audiences, custom audiences from client data\n\r\n- Test new campaign structures to beat control performance - different objectives, placements, bidding strategies, and funnel approaches\n\r\n- Monitor lead quality metrics beyond just CPL - track show-up rates, application rates, sales conversion to ensure we're attracting qualified leads, not just cheap clicks\n\r\n- Propose funnel improvements based on ad performance data - if certain angles convert better, suggest landing page tests or offer adjustments to Marketing Manager\n\r\n\n\r\nCollaboration & Communication (10-15% of time)\n\r\n- Weekly strategy calls with Marketing Manager and potentially client to review performance, discuss optimization plans, align on priorities (calls during Singapore business hours SGT UTC+8)\n\r\n- Daily updates on campaign performance - proactive communication about wins, issues, and action plans (no need to wait for someone to ask)\n\r\n- Create performance reports showing key metrics, insights, and recommendations - translate data into business language that clients understand\n\r\n- Coordinate with Creative Specialist on creative briefs, feedback, and iteration priorities based on what's working in campaigns\n\r\n\n\r\nLearning & Systems Building (Ongoing)\n\r\n- Document successful strategies in SOPs and playbooks for scaling, testing protocols, troubleshooting guides to build institutional knowledge\n\r\n- Stay updated on\n Ads platform changes, new features, industry best practices for info product/coaching funnels\n\r\n -Experiment with new platforms (YouTube Ads bonus) when ready to expand beyond\n for client acquisition\n\r\n- Participate in Inner World Training training on AI tools, marketing frameworks, and business-building strategies to level up your strategic thinking\n\r\n\n\r\nRESULTS: HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS\n\r\n\n\r\n1.

After onboarding: demonstrate mastery of our systems with minimal revision cycles and proactive problem-solving.\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

Reliability & Professionalism\n\r\nMeet campaign management expectations with 95%+ on-time delivery of optimizations, daily monitoring during active campaigns, zero critical errors (wrong audiences, broken tracking, budget overspend), and proactive communication about challenges.

You think in ROI, not just cost per click.\n\r\n\n\r\nThrives in Remote Work\n\r\nYou're disciplined, organized, and don't need constant supervision. You create structure for yourself, manage your time effectively, and deliver consistently. You're comfortable with asynchronous communication but also responsive during Singapore business hours when real-time collaboration is needed. You've proven you can work independently and still be a great team player.\n\r\n\n\r\nCares About the Mission\n\r\nYou're genuinely inspired by helping coaches and consultants build market-leading businesses. Seeing client testimonials, transformation stories, and the $45M+ impact we've created excites you. You want to be part of something meaningful, not just collect a paycheck. You believe in abundance over scarcity and want to contribute to others' success.\n\r\n\n\r\nSystematic and Process-Driven\n\r\nYou don't just \"wing it\" with ad campaigns.

Our companies move fast, test aggressively, and care deeply about execution quality.\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause of that, hiring matters a lot. One wrong hire can slow an entire team down. One strong hire can compound results for months or years.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for traditional HR.\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who understands how real marketing and product teams work and can help us consistently bring in the right people.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is a Talent Partner focused on scouting, screening, and placing talent across multiple HYPETRIBE portfolio companies. You will work closely with founders and team leads who are operators, not corporate managers.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not need to use marketing tools, ad platforms, or AI systems yourself. But you must understand how these roles differ in practice. You should clearly know the difference between a junior and a senior media buyer, between a product manager and a venture builder, and between a designer who can actually execute and one who only looks good on a CV.\n\r\n\n\r\nJudgment matters more here than process.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is a strong fit for someone who has recruited for marketing agencies, startups, or performance-driven teams before. You should be comfortable looking at a CV or portfolio and quickly telling whether the experience is real or just buzzwords.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should also be comfortable saying no. Not every candidate is good enough, and protecting standards is part of the job. Rate negotiation is part of the job as well — done firmly, respectfully, and with the long-term health of the company in mind.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will recruit across a wide range of roles depending on what our portfolio companies need at the time. This includes performance marketing and growth roles like media buyers, funnel builders, and conversion specialists. It also includes product and design roles such as product managers, venture builders, and UI/UX or product designers. In addition, you will work on AI-enabled and content-driven roles like video editors, AI-assisted designers, and content creators using modern tools.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are not expected to master these tools. What matters is your ability to pre-qualify candidates correctly and spot real potential early.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn a day-to-day level, you will source and scout candidates across multiple platforms, review CVs and portfolios critically, and conduct first-round screening interviews. Your goal is to shortlist only candidates who are genuinely worth a founder’s time.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will coordinate interviews with founders and team leads, manage hiring pipelines clearly, and handle compensation discussions within defined ranges. Over time, you will also build long-term relationships with strong candidates, even when there is no immediate opening.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not an admin role.\n\r\nWe are not looking for someone who forwards candidates without proper screening, avoids difficult conversations about money, or treats recruiting as a checklist task.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone with high emotional intelligence, strong loyalty to the venture studio and its portfolio companies, and a long-term mindset. Someone who understands that protecting hiring standards and costs is just as important as filling roles.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe role is fully remote and Manila-based. The BGC office is used only for weekly or occasional in-person meetings. Working hours are flexible and depend on hiring activity rather than fixed shifts.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation is not listed publicly. Please include your monthly salary expectation in your application.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen applying, please share the types of roles you have recruited for before and the kinds of companies, agencies, or industries you have worked with. If you want, you can also include a short example of a difficult or high-impact hire you successfully closed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role has real influence.\n\r\nHiring the wrong people slows everything down.\n\r\nHiring the right people compounds growth across the entire portfolio.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you take pride in hiring quality and protecting standards, you’ll fit in well here.

We are looking for someone who already understands what performs well on\n and Instagram in terms of data. You should know how to create creatives that generate low CPC, low CPM and high CTR. Performance is more important than just making something look nice.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be creating ad creatives for a fashion branded dropshipping business. The focus is on women’s apparel, mainly dresses and similar products. Your work will directly influence campaign performance, so understanding Meta testing and creative iteration is essential.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour daily responsibility will be to create creatives for 10 products per day. For each product, you will create approximately 7 different creatives. These creatives should include different styles and variations to allow proper testing inside Meta. In some cases, when we are testing collections instead of single products, you will need to create around 10 creatives for that collection.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe goal is to test multiple creative angles per product, identify what performs best based on data, and then scale the winning styles. You should understand how creative diversity helps Meta optimize and why relying on just one style per product can lead to wasted tests.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who has real experience with fashion dropshipping creatives and understands how to design for performance, not just aesthetics. You should be comfortable working with Canva and familiar with AI tools for creating additional variations when needed. Experience analyzing performance data such as CPC, CPM and CTR is a strong plus.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term opportunity for someone who is structured, fast, and comfortable producing consistent daily output. When applying, please include examples of Meta ad creatives you have personally created for fashion or dropshipping brands. Applications without relevant examples will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you understand performance-driven creative production and are confident you can handle this level of daily output, we would love to hear from you.\n\r\nIf you read this job post send me: kobalt 17                ",

You will also monitor trends, support the creation and performance tracking of ads, and report insights and recommendations to the wider team.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn addition to supporting the property business, you will occasionally edit and produce footage for NXT-GEN, helping to communicate Kingdom-focused messages and support the spreading of the gospel through high-quality, engaging content.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a purpose-driven role suited to someone who is creative, consistent, and dependable, with a strong eye for detail and a passion for using their editing skills to support both business growth and Kingdom impact.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role is Crucial\n\r\nThe role of Video Editor within our organisation is both strategic and highly valued. It sits at the heart of how Syntix Properties is seen, understood, and trusted by the market. By transforming raw footage and updates into clear, high-quality content, you help communicate our ethos of transparency, integrity, and excellence, while keeping our audience consistently informed and engaged.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour work is crucial because our content directly supports the core drivers of the business: ABS/ABR, relationship building, and investor confidence. Every reel, long-form video, thumbnail, and post is an opportunity to show who we are, what we do, and how we operate, turning our projects, knowledge, and personal stories into a repeatable system that attracts deals, partners, and investors. When the content is consistent, on-brand, and delivered on schedule, it maintains momentum, strengthens credibility, and helps the wider team execute business objectives effectively.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat sets this role apart is its dual focus. While your primary output supports the property development business, you will also occasionally edit and produce footage for NXT-GEN. This aspect of the role allows you to use your creative skillset to support a Kingdom-focused mission, helping to communicate messages that contribute to the spreading of the gospel and creating lasting spiritual impact.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this capacity, you enable leaders and the wider team to stay focused on high-level priorities, confident that our message is being delivered with clarity and professionalism across TikTok, Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn. Your contribution plays a direct role in building trust, expanding our network, and supporting sustainable growth, ensuring that the standard of our public output matches the standard we uphold in our work, and supporting a purpose that goes beyond profit.\n\r\n\n\r\nProperty Development Business Support (50%) + Christian Organisation Support (50%)\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Intake: Review raw content uploaded to Dropbox and confirm files are complete, usable, and labelled correctly.\n\r\nEditing (Short + Long Form): Edit videos into short- and long-form formats in line with brand guidelines and the content schedule.\n\r\nThumbnails: Create and upload thumbnails for both short- and long-form content, consistent with brand identity.\n\r\nReview Meeting Prep: Ensure all content is edited and ready for the “Schedule Content Review” meeting.\n\r\nScheduling & Posting: Schedule and post content across TikTok, Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn, ensuring correct captions, hashtags, and timings.\n\r\nTrend Monitoring: Assess trends across platforms and communicate relevant insights and opportunities to the team.\n\r\nPaid Ads: Create, run, and monitor ads across platforms, adjusting creatives and targeting as needed.\n\r\nPerformance Reporting: Review performance of content, posts, and ads; gather data and provide recommendations to the wider team.\n\r\n\n\r\nBenefits of the Role\n\r\nCompetitive Salary: A strong base salary reflective of your experience, skills, and the value you bring to both our business and ministry operations.\n\r\nPerformance-Based Bonuses: Receive a bonus for every successful property acquisition, rewarding your direct contribution to the growth and success of the company.\n\r\nTeam with Vision: Work alongside individuals who are passionate, focused, and aligned around a clear, purpose-driven vision.\n\r\nOpportunity to transition into full-time\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Syntix Properties \n\r\nSyntix Properties is a dynamic property development company with a passion for breathing new life into tired and overlooked buildings.
