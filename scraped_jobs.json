For the Administrative Assistant role, we are only considering applicants with residential real estate experience in some capacity.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe perfect candidate for this role is a Virtual Professional that has worked as a transaction coordinator and/or a listing coordinator for another Realtor or real estate team in Texas, preferably with Keller Williams.

Nothing slips through the cracks on your watch.\n\r\n- Extreme Attention to Detail: Every call, every note, every update gets logged correctly in the CRM.

You thrive on negotiation, handle objections with confidence, and create win-win agreements that get signed.\n\r\n- Driven by Results: You measure success by contracts closed. You hold yourself to high standards and push to hit — and exceed — your targets consistently. You’re motivated by performance and driven by the satisfaction of closing successful deals.\n\r\n- Resilient Problem-Solver: Whether it’s a tough seller, a pricing objection, or a complicated situation, you don’t freeze — you find solutions and move the deal forward. Challenges are part of the role, and you thrive in solving them under pressure.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\n- Minimum 2+ years of experience in real estate acquisitions or seller negotiations\n\r\n- Proven track record of closing real estate deals and securing signed contracts\n\r\n- Excellent English communication skills (spoken and written)\n\r\n- Confidence and professionalism on the phone; ability to build trust and rapport quickly\n\r\n- Familiarity with real estate terms like ARV, repairs, inspection, contingencies, etc.\n\r\n- Strong work ethic, coachability, and ability to follow scripts while sounding natural\n\r\n- Proficiency with CRMs and outbound dialers\n\r\n- Reliable high-speed internet, updated computer, and a quiet workspace\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n- A confident, friendly, and persuasive communicator who thrives on results\n\r\n- Someone who is organized, detail-oriented, and relentless in follow-up\n\r\n- A professional with the drive to close contracts and grow with a fast-moving team\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Join Us?\n\r\n- Competitive pay with structured bonuses\n\r\n- Real opportunities for growth in a professional investment company\n\r\n- Work remotely with a team that supports your success\n\r\n- A chance to close real deals, make a real impact, and develop long-term career skills in acquisitions\n\r\n\n\r\nAt Price Real Estate Investments, acquisitions is the heartbeat of our business.

    "description": "\n                    JOB OVERVIEW\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a visually-driven, trend-savvy Social Media Manager to bring the magic of Berlin to life on screen. \n\r\n\n\r\nWhile our writers handle the deep dives, you will create visual content for Berlin Bound across Instagram,\n, and Pinterest.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour goal is to stop the scroll and get our ideal audience members (Americans traveling to Berlin, Germany) to engage, opt-in, and head to our website. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe want someone who understands that a 7-second reel of a rainy U-Bahn station can sometimes tell a better story than a 2,000-word essay.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be responsible for creative engaging travel guides via shareable social media posts like Instagram carousels and posts in\n Groups. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a part-time, fully remote position with minimal meetings.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don't want fully A.I. generated content, either; we want a truly creative strategist who understands how to build a digital neighborhood.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a social media manager myself, I can teach you what you need to know if you're not comfortable with one of these platforms, but I'm really looking for someone who is (or can become) better than I am.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Creation: Design and edit engaging Reels, text posts, and Carousel posts. You’ll use a mix of user-generated content (UGC), footage and photos provided my me, as well as assets provided by our team. \n\r\n\n\r\nPlatform Management: Manage daily postings and community engagement on Instagram,\n, and Pinterest.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunity Engagement: Spend time each day responding to comments and DMs, and engaging with other travel creators to put Berlin Bound on the map. You'll also engage in other\n Groups about Berlin and Germany on the brand's behalf - authentically helping others and building a name for our brand.\n\r\n\n\r\nTrend Spotting: Stay on top of trending audios and formats in the travel niche and adapt them to \"Berlin style\" quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nContent Repurposing: Take our long-form blog posts (e.g., \"The Best Spätis in Neukölln\") and distill them into high-value social tips or aesthetic \"saveable\" posts.\n\r\n\n\r\nPinterest Growth: Use tools like Tailwind to pin our blog imagery and drive consistent traffic back to the website.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSKILLS & QUALIFICATIONS\n\r\n\n\r\nVisual Eye: You have a \"vibe\" for aesthetics. You know what makes a photo look editorial and what makes a video feel authentic.\n\r\n\n\r\nSocial Native: You live and breathe Instagram, Pinterest, and/or\n. You understand how algorithms work, but you prioritize human connection over hacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nShort-Form Video Editing: Experience with CapCut, InShot, or Canva to create snappy, high-quality video content.\n\r\n\n\r\nCopywriting: Ability to write catchy captions that encourage saves and shares.\n\r\n\n\r\nSelf-Starter: You can look at a blog post about \"The Reichstag\" and independently come up with 3 different ways to promote it on social media.\n\r\n\n\r\nOrganization: You’re comfortable using a content calendar (like Notion or Trello) to keep posts organized and on schedule.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY & BENEFITS\n\r\n\n\r\nPay: $5 USD hourly.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule: Flexible. At first, expect 2-3 hours per week, with more hours available as our social presence grows.\n\r\n\n\r\nThirteenth Month Pay: Included!\n\r\n\n\r\nBirthday Bonus: Bonus equal to 8 hours of work (after 90 days).\n\r\n\n\r\nHealth Insurance Reimbursement: $50 USD per month to contribute towards a monthly healthcare plan from companies like Maxicare or PhilHealth. Must be on the team for at least 90 days to qualify..\n\r\n\n\r\nLaunch Revenue Share: We share our wins! You'll receive bonuses based on the success of our launches.\n\r\n\n\r\nHolidays Off: We respect your time. Offices close for major holidays in the United States and in the Phillipines.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nTo show us your attention to detail and your creative \"spark,\" please follow these steps:\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject Line: Change the subject to: \"Berlin is Trending – [Your Name]\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Berlin\" Test: Search Berlin, and find something that you think would be of interest to tourists. Try to go a bit \"off the beaten path;\" don't just pick the most popular places. Tell us one specific \"vibe\" or \"aesthetic\" about Berlin you’d love to capture in a Reel (e.g., the techno scene, the cozy cafes, the gritty street art). Explain the post you'd create and if you'd like, share a graphic or mockup (you can add your watermark to it to protect your work; we won't steal from you).\n\r\n\n\r\nPortfolio: Attach a link to a social media account you’ve managed or a portfolio showing Reels/graphics you’ve created.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tool: Tell us your favorite tool for video editing or social scheduling and why you prefer it.

Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here. \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed. \n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system. \n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n                ",

Download the raw video fro\n on Google Drive.\n\r\n2. Review my notes for what needs to be cut, and for where to put specific titles\n\r\n3. Do the basic edits and cuts\n\r\n4.

    "description": "\n                    B2B Outreach & Qualification\n\r\nVirtual Assistant — Private Clinics\n\r\nEngland, Scotland, Wales & Ireland  |  Part-Time, Remote  |  Growth Role\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout the Role\n\r\nWe are looking for a structured and professional Virtual Assistant to support outreach to private appointment-based clinics across England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe operate VioConcierge — an AI-powered appointment confirmation system that reduces no-shows and significantly cuts manual admin workload for clinics. The system is positioned as a premium implementation, not a commodity product.\n\r\n\n\r\nClinics do not purchase immediately. Instead, qualified clinics enter through our 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience — a structured onboarding phase where VioConcierge is implemented and performance is measured in real time. After this experience, suitable clinics transition to the full monthly system.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibility is to identify and qualify clinics for entry into this experience. You are the first point of contact and the gatekeeper for the programme.\n\r\n\n\r\n“This is a structured outreach and qualification role. Not a closing role.”\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\r\nYour day-to-day will involve a focused set of outreach and qualification activities:\n\r\nResearching private clinics (dental, aesthetics, physio, medical, and similar)\n\r\nSending personalised LinkedIn and\n outreach messages\n\r\nOpening professional conversations with clinic owners and practice managers\n\r\nAsking structured qualification questions to assess fit\n\r\nInviting suitable clinics to complete our application form\n\r\nUpdating a weekly KPI tracker accurately and consistently\n\r\nSubmitting a weekly performance summary\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Is Not a Sales Closing Role\n\r\nIt is important to be clear about what this role does not involve. All commercial discussions happen internally once a clinic has been qualified through you.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will not:\n\r\nDiscuss pricing or payment terms\n\r\nNegotiate plans or packages\n\r\nClose sales or make commercial promises\n\r\nGuarantee outcomes to prospects\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Will Be Explaining to Clinics\n\r\nTo qualify leads effectively, you will need a solid understanding of what VioConcierge delivers. The key facts you will be communicating are:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience is completely free of charge.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere is no setup cost, no subscription commitment, and no obligation during the 21 days. The clinic receives everything — including VioConcierge credits — at no cost. This is a genuine, risk-free experience, not a trial with hidden conditions.\n\r\n\n\r\nDuring the 21 days, participating clinics:\n\r\nImplement the VioConcierge system within their existing workflows\n\r\nSee measurable reductions in appointment no-shows\n\r\nReduce time spent on manual confirmation calls and follow-ups\n\r\nImprove consistency of patient communication\n\r\nReceive a structured performance report at the end of the 21 days\n\r\n\n\r\nClinics that wish to continue after the 21 days move onto the full VioConcierge monthly system, which involves a setup fee and monthly subscription. That conversation happens entirely with us — not with you. Your role ends at the application.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe experience is selective. We do not invite every clinic that enquires. Part of your role is to ensure only genuinely suitable clinics progress to application.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation Structure\n\r\nThis role pays a fixed USD $500 per month, structured as a base availability fee plus a performance component. There is no ambiguity about what you earn or why.\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly Retainer — USD $500 total\n\r\nThe retainer has two components:\n\r\n\n\r\nBase Availability Fee: USD $350 per month — paid unconditionally each month, provided you are available for required hours and submit your weekly KPI reports.\n\r\nPerformance Component: up to USD $150 per month — paid in full or in part based on your verified application count for that month.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance tiers for the monthly component:\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: In your first calendar month, the full $150 performance component is paid regardless of application count. This gives you time to establish your outreach rhythm before tiers apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional Earnings\n\r\nUSD $5.00 per verified application — every confirmed, qualified application earns you $5 on top of the retainer, paid monthly.\n\r\nUSD $25.00 conversion bonus — paid each time a clinic you sourced completes the 21-day experience and subscribes to the full VioConcierge system.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You Could Realistically Earn\n\r\nA VA consistently hitting mid-range targets — around 20 verified applications per month and one conversion — earns:\n\r\n\n\r\n$500 retainer (full performance component unlocked)\n\r\n$100 in application fees (20 apps × $5)\n\r\n$25 conversion bonus\n\r\nTotal: approximately $625 USD per month, part-time\n\r\n\n\r\nAt strong performance — 30 applications and two conversions — total monthly earnings reach approximately $700 USD. Every metric above the floor goes directly into your pocket.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation will increase with performance and as the role scales.\n\r\n\n\r\nPerformance Expectations — Month 1\n\r\nWe measure quality and targeting over raw volume. Week-on-week improvement matters more than hitting every number from day one.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeekly targets:\n\r\n200–300 personalised outreach messages\n\r\n20–40 replies\n\r\n5–10 completed applications\n\r\n\n\r\nGrowth Opportunity\n\r\nThis role begins focused on private clinics across England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. As performance metrics are proven and the system scales, there is a clear pathway to grow into:\n\r\nSenior Sales Development role\n\r\nTerritory Expansion Lead\n\r\nRevenue-based compensation structure\n\r\nFull-time revenue position\n\r\n\n\r\nWe build for the long term and strongly prefer to promote from within.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho We Are Looking For\n\r\nYou must have:\n\r\nExcellent written professional English\n\r\nComfort with structured B2B outreach processes\n\r\nThe discipline to follow scripts and qualification frameworks precisely\n\r\nStrong KPI tracking habits and consistent weekly reporting\n\r\nAvailability to overlap at least 2–3 hours with UK business hours\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred:\n\r\nPrevious B2B outreach or SDR experience\n\r\nLinkedIn outreach experience\n\r\nExperience targeting healthcare, dental, or clinic businesses\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is not suited to high-volume automation approaches, mass broadcasting tools, or commission-only closers. We represent a premium implementation experience and expect our outreach to reflect that standard.\n\r\n\n\r\nTone Standard\n\r\nAll outreach on behalf of VioConcierge should feel professional, direct, and respectful of the clinic owner’s time. We are not selling a software subscription — we are inviting a select group of clinics into a structured programme that costs them nothing to experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience is completely free of charge to the clinic. There is no obligation, no setup cost during the 21 days, and no commitment required. This is a genuine, no-risk offer — and your outreach should communicate that clearly without overselling it.\n\r\n\n\r\nAn example of the register we expect:\n\r\n\n\r\n“Hi [Name], I work with a small number of private clinics on a structured 21-day implementation that reduces appointment no-shows — at no cost to the practice. We’re selective about who we invite. Would a brief conversation make sense?”\n\r\n\n\r\nNote the phrasing: “at no cost to the practice” rather than “free.” The offer is identical, but the language preserves the premium positioning. Clinic owners have seen free trials. They have not been selectively invited to a no-cost structured implementation. That distinction matters and should come through in how you write.\n\r\n\n\r\nShort. Specific. No pressure. This is the standard your outreach should meet.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nTo apply, please answer all of the following questions. Incomplete applications will not be reviewed.\n\r\n\n\r\nImportant: Begin your application with the word “Structured” to confirm you have read this post in full.\n\r\n\n\r\nWrite a short LinkedIn message introducing the 21-Day Signature Implementation Experience to a private dental clinic owner. (This is the most important part of your application.)\n\r\nDescribe your B2B outreach experience — sectors, tools used, and typical volumes.\n\r\nHow would you identify and research private dental clinics in England?\n\r\nConfirm your expected monthly salary in USD.\n\r\nConfirm your weekly availability and your overlap with UK business hours.\n\r\n\n\r\nVioConcierge is a product of Smart AI Solutions. We are building something long-term and are selective about who joins the team.                ",

We specialise in the safe and efficient transportation of a wide range of civil machinery and heavy access equipment. \n\r\n\n\r\nOur company motto, “Your Assets, Our Priority”, reflects our commitment to the secure and dependable movement of our clients’ valuable machinery. We take pride in delivering a high level of client satisfaction through trusted service and operational excellence.\n\r\n\n\r\nEngagement Overview\n\r\nPriority Haulage is seeking a capable and dependable Creative Designer to support ongoing brand execution across digital and print channels within a fast-paced, growing business.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is an ad-hoc, task-based role, with work arising as needed, primarily across social media visuals, website updates, and marketing collateral.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role suits a designer who can reliably step in as required, work independently, and deliver clean, accurate outputs within agreed timeframes; it is not suited to candidates whose availability is constrained by full-time employment or competing priorities.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a delivery-focused engagement (not strategic ownership). Work is assigned on a task-by-task basis, with no guaranteed hours, and workload will vary depending on business needs.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Responsibilities\n\r\nSocial Media Visuals\n\r\n• Prepare static and simple animated graphics for scheduled posts.\n\r\n• Apply existing brand guidelines consistently across all assets.\n\r\n• Deliver publication-ready files in the required formats and dimensions.\n\r\n• No content strategy, copywriting, or performance analysis required — visual assets only.\n\r\n\n\r\nCollateral Management\n\r\n• Update and maintain existing collateral (PDFs, brochures, price lists, booklets).\n\r\n• Apply text, layout, and formatting updates accurately and consistently.\n\r\n• Ensure all final exports are fully reviewed before publication.\n\r\n• Export, version, and publish final files correctly, with no redundant pages or legacy content.\n\r\n• Maintain clear version control and naming conventions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWebsite Updates (Squarespace)\n\r\n• Perform minor content updates only (text, images, layout adjustments).\n\r\n• Follow existing site structure, templates, and styling.\n\r\n• Ensure visual consistency across pages after updates.\n\r\n• No redesign, development work, SEO, or performance optimisation required.\n\r\n\n\r\nProcess & System Management\n\r\n• Conduct a final self-review on all deliverables prior to submission or publication.\n\r\n• Ensure all working files and final assets are stored in the agreed OneDrive structure.\n\r\n• Transfer editable source files (not just published outputs) upon task completion.\n\r\n• Follow established publishing and handover processes without prompting.\n\r\n• Flag blockers or uncertainties early rather than post-delivery.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Experience & Capability\n\r\nThis role requires demonstrated experience operating at a senior execution level in a fast-paced, accountability-driven environment. Applicants should meet the majority of the criteria below:\n\r\n\n\r\n• 5+ years’ hands-on experience in graphic design, brand execution, or marketing operations within a commercial environment.\n\r\n• Proven experience delivering production-ready outputs (social media assets, PDFs, and brochures) with minimal rework.\n\r\n• Strong working knowledge of brand systems and visual consistency, including typography, spacing, layout, and publishing standards.\n\r\n• Practical experience managing and maintaining live business assets, not just concept or campaign work.\n\r\n• Advanced proficiency in Adobe Creative Cloud, particularly:\n\r\n   o InDesign\n\r\n   o Illustrator\n\r\n   o Photoshop\n\r\n• Confident working with Squarespace (content updates, layout adjustments, asset management).\n\r\n• Demonstrated ability to operate independently in a remote environment, with strong self-management, reliability, and consistent follow-through without supervision.\n\r\n• High level of technical proficiency across modern business tools, including:\n\r\n   o Notion\n\r\n   o ChatGPT\n\r\n   o Microsoft 365 (Outlook, OneDrive, Teams)\n\r\n   o Loom (when required for handover or explanation)\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred / Advantageous Experience \n\r\nWhile not mandatory, the following would be considered a strong advantage for future contribution:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Basic HTML/CSS knowledge for minor content adjustments within an existing CMS (not required for day-to-day work).\n\r\n• Exposure to transport, logistics, or operations-based businesses, where accuracy, consistency, and clarity are critical.\n\r\n• Experience supporting brand rollout or consolidation phases, operating within established brand guidelines.\n\r\n• Strong asset and file management practices, including version control and maintaining shared collateral libraries.\n\r\n• Webflow experience, including CMS usage and layout structuring; custom development experience is a plus for future platform evolution but not required initially.\n\r\n• Experience working alongside marketing or growth teams, with a clear execution focus rather than ownership of strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\nPersonal Attributes\n\r\n• Highly organised and detail-oriented, with strong self-review habits and the ability to manage multiple creative deliverables reliably.\n\r\n• Clear and professional communicator, able to operate autonomously in a remote environment while collaborating effectively with stakeholders.\n\r\n• Strong visual judgement and problem-solving capability, particularly in identifying layout, consistency, and publishing issues before submission.\n\r\n• Proactive and improvement-oriented, with the ability to refine workflows, adapt to feedback, and maintain quality under delivery pressure.\n\r\n• Professional, client-focused mindset, demonstrating ownership, high execution standards, and accountability for final outputs.\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication Requirement\n\r\nA portfolio link is required.

The entrepreneurs who you'd be an assistant to are looking for a lifetime assistant.\n\r\n- Great Place to Work: These entrepreneurs are known to have a super high retention rate of employees and create a great work environment.\n\r\n- Creative Work: From planning memorable trips to picking out the perfect gift, this role lets you flex your creative muscles and thoughtful side every day.\n\r\n- Variety: No two days will feel the same. You’ll get to research, plan, coach, organize, and more.\n\r\n- Paid Leave: You'll get at least 10 days of paid leave plus major holidays.\n\r\n- Remote Flexibility: Work from the comfort of your home and gain flexibility with hours once trust is built.\n\r\n\n\r\nDesired Attributes\n\r\n- Extremely caring, social people-person who will excel in personal tasks\n\r\n- High attention to detail and organizational skills\n\r\n- Very strong written and oral English skills\n\r\n- Minimum 50 Mbps Internet Speed\n\r\n- Designated office space in your home\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply and ensure your application is considered, do all of the following two steps:\n\r\n1.

    "description": "\n                    We are hiring a FULL-TIME (40 hours per week, 5 days a week) highly skilled Video Editor to join our fast-growing Shopify e-commerce team. This is not a casual freelance position. We are looking for a serious performance editor who understands direct-response marketing and knows how to create video ads that convert impulsive buyers into immediate customers. If you only focus on making aesthetic edits without understanding conversion psychology, this role is not for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur brand relies heavily on powerful, scroll-stopping creatives that drive purchases. Your primary responsibility will be producing high-converting video ads for platforms such as Meta and TikTok. You must be capable of delivering 4–6 high-quality video ads per day, ranging from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, while maintaining strong performance standards. Speed matters, but quality and conversion performance matter more.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be responsible for editing UGC-style ads, product demonstrations, problem-solution creatives, competitor-style variations, and scaling ads. You must be able to combine footage from multiple sources seamlessly, source B-roll using our established systems (even when raw content is limited), structure strong 3-second hooks, build emotional engagement, optimize pacing for retention, and add captions, sound design, and motion graphics that increase watch time and conversion rate.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must be highly proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro. Experience with After Effects, CapCut Pro, Runway ML, Pika, Descript, and other AI-based editing tools is strongly preferred. You must be comfortable using AI tools in your workflow, including voice cloning and AI voiceovers with ElevenLabs. You should understand how to enhance ad quality using AI without making it look artificial or overproduced.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional responsibilities include accurate labeling and organization of all video ads, working within \n for structured reviews and feedback, collaborating through Miro boards for creative planning and ad structuring, revising creatives quickly based on feedback, following detailed instructions precisely, and collaborating effectively with the team. You must be able to take a blueprint and not only execute it correctly but elevate it. We are not looking for someone who follows instructions mechanically. We want someone who understands the structure and masters it.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements include strong proficiency in Adobe Premiere Pro, proven experience in e-commerce video editing with a deep understanding of direct-response marketing, strong storytelling and pacing skills, branding awareness, the ability to work quickly and efficiently under tight deadlines, and full reliability for a consistent 40-hour work week schedule. You must think like a marketer, not just an editor. You should understand impulsive buying psychology, hook rate, CTR, retention, and conversion rate. Metrics matter in this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nShortlisted candidates will be required to complete a paid test edit based on a blueprint we provide. You will also participate in a one-week paid trial period to demonstrate your ability to meet performance and volume expectations. This process is designed to filter for high-level talent only.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a long-term position with consistent workload and growth opportunities inside a fast-paced, performance-driven environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, submit your portfolio showcasing your best-performing e-commerce video ads, a Loom video introducing yourself and explaining why we should hire you along with your expertise in video editing, your WhatsApp contact information for communication, confirmation of your availability for full-time work (40 hours per week), and include “MIDNIGHT” in your\n subject line. Failure to follow these instructions will result in automatic disqualification.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are not confident in your ability to produce conversion-driven creatives at scale, do not apply. We are building a serious brand and we are hiring accordingly.                ",
