    "description": "\n                    Howdy y'all!  We are New York based marketing agency that is looking for assistance with graphic design specifically pertaining to pre-press and printing.  If you believe you qualify, you must review all the requirements below.  If you do not have specific experience in pre-press and printing, it is not likely you should apply for this position, so please read the post completely and thoroughly, and, respond accordingly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe currently work with Adobe InDesign but are willing consider a move to Canva Pro.  We currently use Adobe Creative Suite, but you would need to provide your own Canva Pro account.  We like Canva Pro but haven't yet fully committed to it.  Therefore, our work is initially in Adobe InDesign (which is the standard still for American pre-press work).\n\r\n\n\r\nHere are the requirements to apply; when you respond to this post, just please make it very clear that you can meet each requirement:\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Robust experience using either Adobe Creative Suite or Canva Pro.  (Note: having only an unlicensed version of Canva would be insufficient for this position).\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Depth of commercially produced and commercially viable pre-press and printed work; such designs would be for printed postcards, or brochures, or magazines, or envelopes, or letterhead, or annual reports, or similar.  In other words, you must be able to demonstrate that you have significant pre-press experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Online portfolio (such as \n) that would be easy for us to review your past efforts. Unfortunately, we will not comb through anyone's online digital image repositories to glean design talents and abilities (e.g. we will not be going through images on GoogleDrive, Dropbox, etc.).\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Abidance of pre-press \"best practices\" in graphic design.  Examples of standard pre-press best practices are:  use of layers (images/text) in InDesign, version control, packaged subfolders (InDesign), proper use of white space (and reverse white space), knowledge of design effects, controlled use of fonts that are either common or packaged with your design, and perhaps most of all, crops-for-bleeds (crop marks). [Note: if you are not familiar with these terms, it is not likely that this position is for you.]\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Availability such that your hours coi\n with our hours here in New York (New York time = GMT-5 or Eastern Standard Time [EST]).  It is not necessary that you work an overnight, but you will need to have overlap at least our time zone for a minimum of 3 hours.  Further, you must be available to respond within 12 hours if we need assistance.  While it is, of course, unreasonable that your availability would be \"on demand\", we nonetheless must establish some sort of minimum and agreed upon response time protocols.\n\r\n\n\r\n*  Consciousness that the design work for our clients is time sensitive and budget sensitive.  Example: on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, one side of a 5 1/2\" x 8 1/2\" postcard would take no more than one (1) hour; working on a two-sided card would therefore take no more than one and a half (1.5) to two (2) hours.  The turn-around would need to be within 24 hours.  We would pay by the hour.  \n\r\n\n\r\nGood news:  we can train for U.S. Postal Service regulations regarding physical mailpiece standards and layout out.  Further, we also know that you cannot read minds so our job ticket descriptions are usually very detailed.  However, we are unable to train for carefulness of effort and awareness of reading job tickets properly.  Once completed, your files would be re-uploaded to our cloud server or otherwise accessible to us online to our digital network.  Finally, your use of the English language would need to be solid and there is an expectation that your attitude would be positive and of good cheer.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you apply, please (a) respond here and (b) also send an\n to \n wherein your will state \"Hey HR Manager, I really read the WHOLE post!\".  In this way, we'll know that - yes, you guessed it - actually read the whole post.  Questions?  First, respond positive to the requirements above, and then we are happy to answer any questions!\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you!                ",

I run a growing marketing agency that works with real local service businesses. We actually care if the ads work, because clients stick around when they do. I need someone sharp to make sure campaigns don’t just run, but perform. Think of it like babysitting… except the baby is a\n Ads Manager account that sometimes throws tantrums.\n\r\n\n\r\n**What You’ll Get**\n\r\n\n\r\n* A boss who won’t micromanage your every click (I hate that too).\n\r\n* Straightforward systems that already bring results—you’ll just be turning the knobs and testing smartly.\n\r\n* The chance to work with businesses where your results are actually felt. You’ll see the impact, not just a spreadsheet.\n\r\n* A seat at the table as we grow—your ideas won’t get buried under “corporate.”\n\r\n\n\r\n**Requirements**\n\r\n\n\r\n* You’ve run Meta Ads before and have proof (case studies, screenshots, actual data—\ns don’t count).\n\r\n* You know what a good CPL looks like and how to get there.\n\r\n* You can work 8am–1pm MST, no ghosting.\n\r\n* Clear communicator. If you spot something broken, you say it. If you have an idea, you bring it.\n\r\n* Detail-oriented, but not to the point where you alphabetize your sock drawer.\n\r\n\n\r\n**What I’m Looking For**\n\r\nI’m a leader, and I want to build with leaders. I don’t need a button-pusher. I need someone who owns their work, solves problems, and can laugh when Meta d\n to randomly reject an ad for “violating community standards” because it showed a picture of a lawn.\n\r\n\n\r\n**Compensation**\n\r\n\n\r\n* Competitive and based on your results. Show me you can bring the leads in, and we’ll take care of you.\n\r\n* Long-term role with room to grow as the agency grows.\n\r\n\n\r\n**How to Apply**\n\r\nSend me:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Your experience running Meta Ads.\n\r\n2. Proof of past results (screenshots, CPLs, etc.).\n\r\n3. Confirmation you’re good with 8am–1pm MST.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want a job where your work directly drives client growth and you don’t have to deal with corporate nonsense, this is it.                ",

    "description": "\n                    # AI Video Production Specialist — YouTube Channel Builder | Channel Research & Replication | Python/AI Coding | Thumbnails | Automation\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Job Description\n\r\n\n\r\nWe run a growing network of YouTube channels producing AI-assisted video content at scale. We're looking for someone with an obsessive eye for detail who can take any successful YouTube channel as a reference and recreate everything about it — the thumbnail style, title format, video structure, pacing, transitions, fonts, colors, music choices, subtitle style, description format, tags, upload schedule — down to the last pixel. Then put it into production and move on to the next one.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a programming-heavy role. Our videos are built programmatically — Python scripts, FFmpeg, AI APIs, TTS engines, image generation pipelines, subtitle generators, and automated assembly. You're not dragging clips around in a timeline. You're writing and modifying code that produces videos. If you can't work in a terminal, read Python, and debug errors, this isn't for you.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Core Job\n\r\n\n\r\n1. You actively research and find successful YouTube channels — both channels already using AI production and channels that aren't but could be replicated at scale using AI tools and automation. You identify opportunities and bring them to us.\n\r\n2. I also send you YouTube channel or video references to replicate.\n\r\n3. You study every single detail: thumbnail layout, font choices, color palette, text positioning, background style, title patterns, video length, intro style, pacing, music, voice tone, subtitle font/size/color/position, description template, tags, upload frequency, end screens, pinned comments — EVERYTHING.\n\r\n4. You assess what can be automated vs what needs manual work, and determine if the channel format can be profitably produced at scale.\n\r\n5. You document it all in a clear spec sheet.\n\r\n6. You configure and code our production pipeline to replicate that exact style — using Python, Claude Code, and AI tools to build or modify scripts for thumbnails, TTS voiceovers, subtitle formatting, and video assembly.\n\r\n7. You produce test videos and compare them side-by-side with the reference until they're indistinguishable in style and quality.\n\r\n8. You launch the channel into production.\n\r\n9. Repeat for the next channel.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Be Doing Day-to-Day\n\r\n\n\r\n- Researching and identifying successful YouTube channels that are either fully AI-produced or could be replicated at scale using AI — analyzing their niche, content format, view counts, growth trajectory, and production style to determine if they're viable targets\n\r\n- Analyzing successful YouTube channels and breaking down exactly what makes them work (visual style, content structure, production quality, metadata strategy)\n\r\n- Writing and modifying Python scripts using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to customize production pipelines for each channel's unique style\n\r\n- Recreating thumbnail templates that match reference channels precisely (fonts, colors, layouts, image styles, text effects)\n\r\n- Configuring TTS voice settings, subtitle styles, video pacing, and assembly parameters to match reference content\n\r\n- Debugging and troubleshooting production code — reading error logs, fixing broken scripts, improving existing automation\n\r\n- Quality-checking every output against the reference — catching details others would miss (wrong font weight, subtitle position off by a few pixels, color slightly wrong, pacing too fast)\n\r\n- Managing video uploads, metadata, descriptions, tags, and scheduling across multiple channels\n\r\n- Building new automation features and tools as needed\n\r\n- Testing new AI tools and techniques to improve output quality\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Must-Haves\n\r\n\n\r\n- Proven experience with AI video production — you have actually used AI tools AND code to produce video content at scale, not just plugged prompts into websites. You must be able to show examples.\n\r\n- Experience programmatically creating video content or livestreams — using Python, FFmpeg, automation scripts, APIs, or similar tools to generate videos through code, not manual editing. If you've only ever used Premiere or CapCut by hand, this isn't the role.\n\r\n- Python programming ability — you will be writing, reading, modifying, and debugging Python scripts daily. This includes working with APIs (TTS, image generation, AI models), FFmpeg commands, file processing, and automation logic. AI coding assistants like Claude Code will help you, but you still need to understand what the code is doing.\n\r\n- Comfortable working in a terminal / command line (running scripts, SSH into servers, navigating folders, reading error logs, managing processes)\n\r\n- Obsessive attention to detail — if you're the kind of person who notices when a font is 1px too large or a color is slightly off, you're our person. If you think \"close enough\" is good enough, this role isn't for you.\n\r\n- Strong visual eye — you can look at a thumbnail and immediately identify the font, layout technique, color values, and effects used\n\r\n- Understanding of YouTube (what makes channels successful, how the algorithm works, metadata optimization)\n\r\n- Strong English communication skills\n\r\n- Self-starter who figures things out independently\n\r\n- Willing to use their own Claude Pro account for AI coding (we reimburse the $20/month subscription cost)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Big Pluses\n\r\n\n\r\n- Experience researching YouTube niches, analyzing channel performance, and identifying content opportunities\n\r\n- Experience managing or growing YouTube channels\n\r\n- Graphic design skills (Photoshop, Canva, Figma)\n\r\n- FFmpeg knowledge\n\r\n- Experience with TTS tools (ElevenLabs, Edge TTS, Kokoro, etc.)\n\r\n- Linux servers / SSH / VPS management\n\r\n- AI image generation experience (Stable Diffusion, Flux, Midjourney, DALL-E)\n\r\n- Video editing in any NLE (Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, CapCut)\n\r\n- Experience with subtitle/caption styling\n\r\n- Git / version control basics\n\r\n- Experience building or working with automation pipelines\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## Work Details\n\r\n\n\r\n- Position: Part-time (20 hours/week)\n\r\n- Rate: $10 - $15 USD/hour depending on experience and skills\n\r\n- Hours: Flexible schedule, must overlap with North American hours for communication\n\r\n- Location: Remote (Philippines-based preferred)\n\r\n- Start: Immediately\n\r\n- Tools provided: Access to our servers, dashboards, and production systems. Claude Pro subscription reimbursed monthly.\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n## How to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Applications that don't follow these instructions will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\nStart your application message with the word KOKORO and include the phrase \"blue dog\" somewhere in your application to confirm you've read the entire posting.\n\r\n\n\r\nThen answer these questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. What is your experience with AI video production or programmatically creating video content? Describe the specific tools, scripts, or pipelines you've used. What did you build? How many videos were you producing? What was automated vs manual?\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Go to this YouTube channel: ",

Flexible hours but must overlap with Eastern Standard Time (EST) for at least 3–4 hours daily.\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nWindsor Drake is a mergers & acquisitions (M&A) advisory firm based in Canada. We help founders of established businesses ($1M–$20M+ in revenue) sell their companies to qualified buyers. We are building a high-volume outbound sales machine and need someone exceptional to own our lead research and list building operations.\n\r\nThis is not a generic VA role. You will be the engine behind a 4-person outbound sales team. The quality of the lists you build directly determines whether our team books meetings or wastes their day calling the wrong people. If you're great at this, you'll have a massive impact on a fast-growing company.\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nYour core job is to build hyper-targeted, enriched lead lists of Canadian business owners and potential buyers using Clay, Apollo, and other research tools.\n\r\nSpecifically:\n\r\n\n\r\nBuild and maintain lead lists in Clay and Apollo targeting Canadian founders and business owners in specific sectors (manufacturing, HVAC, construction, healthcare services, tech, professional services, etc.)\n\r\nEnrich every lead with: verified direct\n, direct cell phone number, LinkedIn profile URL, company revenue estimate, employee count, years in business, founder tenure, business sector/industry\n\r\nCross-reference and verify data using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, company websites, government business registries, and other online sources\n\r\nSegment and tag lists by geography (province/city), industry, revenue range, employee count, and founder characteristics\n\r\nClean and deduplicate data before importing to HubSpot CRM\n\r\nContinuously test new data sources, Clay enrichment workflows, and Apollo search filters to improve list quality and hit rate\n\r\nTrack list performance metrics (which lists lead to the most booked meetings) and optimize accordingly\n\r\nResearch and identify potential buyer leads (private equity firms, strategic acquirers, family offices, search funds) targeting Canadian businesses\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You Must Know\n\r\nRequired — must have hands-on experience with:\n\r\n\n\r\nClay (building tables, enrichment workflows, waterfall enrichment, AI prompts within Clay, integrations)\n\r\n\n (advanced search filters, saved searches, list building, data export, sequence setup)\n\r\nLinkedIn Sales Navigator (boolean search, lead lists, account lists)\n\r\nHubSpot CRM (importing contacts, list management, custom properties, basic workflows)\n\r\nGoogle Sheets / Excel (data cleaning, deduplication, VLOOKUP, formatting for CRM import)\n\r\n\n\r\nNice to have:\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience with other enrichment tools (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Lusha, RocketReach, BuiltWith, Crunchbase)\n\r\nFamiliarity with Canadian business databases (Industry Canada, provincial business registries)\n\r\nExperience supporting outbound sales teams or SDR/BDR teams\n\r\nUnderstanding of the M&A industry or business brokerage\n\r\nZapier or \n for automating data flows\n\r\n\n\r\nWho You Are\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are obsessed with data quality. You'd rather spend an extra 30 minutes verifying 50 leads than hand over a list with bad phone numbers and wrong\ns. You take pride in clean, accurate data.\n\r\nYou are resourceful and creative. When Apollo doesn't have a phone number, you don't stop — you check Clay enrichment, LinkedIn, the company website, Canada411, provincial registries, whatever it takes to find it.\n\r\nYou are organized and systematic. You build repeatable processes, not one-off lists. You document your workflows so they can scale.\n\r\nYou can work independently. We'll give you targeting criteria and you'll go build the lists without needing to be micromanaged.\n\r\nYou communicate clearly. If a list isn't coming together well or you're hitting dead ends in a sector, you tell us proactively — not after wasting 3 days.\n\r\nYou understand that your work directly impacts revenue. When you deliver a great list, our team books meetings. When the list is bad, they waste their day. You take that seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\nWithin your first 30 days:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've built Clay workflows for our top 3 target sectors\n\r\nYou've delivered your first 500+ enriched, verified leads to HubSpot\n\r\nOur outbound team is calling your lists and booking meetings\n\r\n\n\r\nWithin 90 days:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've built a repeatable system for producing 1,000+ new enriched leads per month across multiple sectors and geographies\n\r\nYou're tracking which list segments convert best and proactively recommending where to focus\n\r\nYou've identified and tested at least 2–3 new data sources or enrichment methods beyond Apollo and Clay\n\r\nOur team never runs out of people to call\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nDo NOT send a generic application. We will ignore it.\n\r\nInstead, send us a short Loom video (3–5 minutes max) where you:\n\r\n\n\r\nShow us a Clay table you've built for a previous client or project — walk us through the enrichment workflow you set up, what data sources you used, and why\n\r\nShow us an Apollo search you've built — explain the filters you chose and how you'd refine it for targeting Canadian business owners with $2M–$10M in revenue\n\r\nTell us one thing most people get wrong about lead list building and what you do differently\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you don't have Clay experience but are very strong in Apollo + LinkedIn Sales Navigator and are confident you can learn Clay quickly, still apply — but be honest about it in your video.\n\r\nApplications without a Loom video will not be reviewed.\n\r\nWhy This Role Is Different\n\r\nThis isn't data entry. This isn't scraping random\ns. You'll be the person who determines which Canadian founders our team talks to every single day. The data you build becomes a long-term strategic asset for our company. You'll work directly with the founder (not through 3 layers of management), get real feedback on how your lists perform, and have a clear line of sight between your work and the company's growth.\n\r\nIf you're the kind of person who gets excited about building the perfect lead list and seeing it convert into real business, we want to talk to you.

We don’t want corporate personas or scripted support, we want real people who show up as themselves and care about doing the right thing.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is about thinking proactively, putting yourself in the customer’s shoes, and going above and beyond by default, not just reacting to tickets.\n\r\n\n\r\nIntegrity here means a “pick up the trash” mindset. If something is wrong, no matter how small or who caused it, you fix it without being asked.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe goal is simple: customers should walk away thinking, “Why isn’t every brand like this?” Feeling confident, respected, and genuinely taken care of.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen someone buys from BALANZI, they should feel one thing above all else: we stand behind our word.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is Really For\n\r\n\n\r\n- You thrive in high standards\n\r\n- You take REAL ownership \n\r\n- You learn fast and figure things out\n\r\n- You perform best when the stakes are real \n\r\n- You care about building something meaningful \n\r\n- You’re willing to get your hands dirty to move the mission forward\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Core Values\n\r\n\n\r\nThe right person for this role will connect deeply with our values, live them daily, and understand why they’re essential for building something great.\n\r\n\n\r\nNo Compromises – You never compromise on anything, from product to customer experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nUltimate Perseverance – You don’t stop.

We chased money, sold products we didn’t believe in, and eventually realized we hated what we were building. So we scrapped everything and kept only one thing: Cuban Links - the only product our customers truly loved.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver the last 12 months, we’ve rebuilt BALANZI from the ground up: redesigned products, raised our quality standards, refined our positioning, and committed fully to becoming the #1 destination for Cuban Links.\n\r\n\n\r\nToday, we’re a small, passionate team focused on excellence, long-term thinking, and building a brand we’re truly proud of; never compromising on product, customer experience, or our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Work For BALANZI? \n\r\n\n\r\n- Your work has real impact, and it will directly shape BALANZI and its future\n\r\n- You work directly with the founders, not buried under layers of management\n\r\n- You’ll have real ownership, autonomy, and the ability to move the needle fast\n\r\n- You’ll grow faster here than in any traditional environment \n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll join a team with high standards, no bureaucracy, and a clear mission we believe in\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this gets you fired up, then click below and apply now.

    "description": "\n                    Real Estate Acquisitions Specialist (Remote)\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us\n\r\nPrice Real Estate Investments is a multi-market U.S. based real estate investment company focused on acquiring off-market properties directly from homeowners. We specialize in building strong relationships with sellers, negotiating with them, and closing deals virtually. Our team is fully remote, but our impact is nationwide — and we’re growing quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for an experienced Real Estate Acquisitions Specialist to join our acquisitions team. This role is critical to our business: you’ll be speaking directly with homeowners, negotiating terms, and guiding sellers through the contract signing process. If you’ve personally made offers to sellers and closed contracts over the phone, this is an opportunity to put your skills to work in a high-energy, professional environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation\n\r\n$10/hour USD base pay\n\r\n\n\r\nPlus Monthly Contract Bonuses for getting offers accepted:\n\r\n• Bronze: 2 signed contracts = $500 bonus\n\r\n• Silver: 3 signed contracts = $1,000 bonus\n\r\n• Gold: 4 signed contracts = $1,500 bonus\n\r\n• Platinum: 5+ signed contracts = $2,000 bonus\n\r\n\n\r\nOn-target earnings can range from $2,500–$3,500+ per month depending on performance. Pay dates are on the 1st and 15th of each month.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe believe in rewarding results. Our top performers earn meaningful bonuses based on closed contracts and consistent production.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule\n\r\nFull-time, Monday to Friday\n\r\n9:00 AM – 6:00 PM CST\n\r\nRemote position, work from your own secure setup\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Doing\n\r\n- Engage with homeowners (seller leads), build authentic rapport, and manage conversations with professionalism\n\r\n- Follow a proven acquisitions script while sounding natural and confident\n\r\n- Ask strong follow-up questions to uncover seller motivation and property condition\n\r\n- Make verbal offers, negotiate price and terms, and walk sellers through agreements using DocuSign\n\r\n- Handle objections effectively and push deals forward toward signed contracts\n\r\n- Maintain organized notes, offers, and seller updates in our CRM\n\r\n- Collaborate closely with the acquisitions team and leadership\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat It Takes to Succeed Here\n\r\n- Relentless Follow-Up: Sellers don’t always respond the first time — or the second.

You learn strategy by doing the work, spotting patterns, and understanding what actually performs, not by sitting on the sidelines.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you consistently execute with speed, attention to detail, and sound judgment, this role is the foundation for growing into a \n\r\nCreative Strategist position.\n\r\n\n\r\nWho This Is Really For\n\r\n\n\r\n- You thrive in high standards\n\r\n- You take REAL ownership \n\r\n- You learn fast and figure things out\n\r\n- You perform best when the stakes are real \n\r\n- You care about building something meaningful \n\r\n- You’re willing to get your hands dirty to move the mission forward\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Core Values\n\r\n\n\r\nThe right person for this role will connect deeply with our values, live them daily, and understand why they’re essential for building something great.\n\r\n\n\r\n1. No Compromises – You never compromise on anything, from product to customer experience.\n\r\n2. Ultimate Perseverance – You don’t stop. The challenge doesn’t matter; there’s always a solution to a problem. \n\r\n3. Extreme Ownership – You take full ownership. You care about the details and deliver work you’re proud to put your name on.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf these values don’t feel like a natural fit, please do not apply. \n\r\n\n\r\nMain Responsibilities: \n\r\n\n\r\n- Own the full intake, review, and breakdown of all raw creative assets across customers, creators, partners, and internal shoots, ensuring no footage is wasted \n\r\n\n\r\n- Break down every raw file into deployable components including hooks, talking heads, B-roll, and standalone raw ads, with full timestamping and context tagging \n\r\n\n\r\n- Maintain and update shared B-roll, hooks, and talking-head banks, ensuring assets are categorized by format, intent, tone, and use case \n\r\n\n\r\n- Assign the best-fit assets to scripts and angles provided by the Creative Strategist, flagging gaps where new footage is required \n\r\n\n\r\n- Act as the single point of contact for editors by preparing precise editor requests with timestamps, clip order, notes, and clear do/don’t rules \n\r\n\n\r\n- Manage first-pass quality control on all edited assets, blocking anything that creates doubt, feels salesy, or breaks BALANZI’s calm, confident tone \n\r\n\n\r\n- Organize and maintain a clean creative asset library so footage is reusable across ads, cutdowns, and future campaigns without reshoots \n\r\n\n\r\n- Ensure editors are never blocked, creative velocity stays high, and strategy can be executed without friction or delays \n\r\n\n\r\n- Offload execution-heavy creative work from the founders and strategist so they can focus on direction, growth, and decision-making  \n\r\n\n\r\nPrior Experience / Skills\n\r\n\n\r\n- No experience required\n\r\n- We're hiring for potential, not experience\n\r\n- Your performance during the trial is all that matters\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout Us \n\r\n\n\r\nBALANZI exists to build the world’s best Cuban Link chain for everyday life - so that men can move through life feeling confident, without ever needing to take off their chain or change who they are.\n\r\n\n\r\nFounded in 2020, we didn’t start with a big mission. We chased money, sold products we didn’t believe in, and eventually realized we hated what we were building. So we scrapped everything and kept only one thing: Cuban Links - the only product our customers truly loved.\n\r\n\n\r\nOver the last 12 months, we’ve rebuilt BALANZI from the ground up: redesigned products, raised our quality standards, refined our positioning, and committed fully to becoming the #1 destination for Cuban Links.\n\r\n\n\r\nToday, we’re a small, passionate team focused on excellence, long-term thinking, and building a brand we’re truly proud of; never compromising on product, customer experience, or our team.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy Work For BALANZI? \n\r\n\n\r\n- Your work has real impact, and it will directly shape BALANZI and its future\n\r\n- You work directly with the founders, not buried under layers of management\n\r\n- You’ll have real ownership, autonomy, and the ability to move the needle fast\n\r\n- You’ll grow faster here than in any traditional environment \n\r\n- You’ll join a team with high standards, no bureaucracy, and a clear mission we believe in\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this gets you fired up, then click below and apply now.

    "description": "\n                    ABOUT US\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are a US-based commerce company, the American arm of an established European e-commerce and trading group operating across 29 countries with 650,000+ products across multiple brands in construction, home improvement, sustainability, and premium bath & kitchen.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are also a US distributor of a European contactless QR-payment solution for churches, nonprofits, and venues.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur motto: \"Do it with Passion or don't do it at all.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are building a Commerce 4.0 infrastructure with AI-driven automation, and we need a sharp, resourceful person to become the CEO's digital right hand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT A TYPICAL VA ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who thinks like an entrepreneur, not just an assistant. You will co-build operations across the USA and Southeast Asia, manage teams, drive sales, and grow with us into a leadership position. If you want to be part of building something big - this is your opportunity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR ROLE - SIX KEY AREAS\n\r\n\n\r\n1. US FINTECH PRODUCT - Sales & Distribution Support\n\r\nWe distribute a European contactless QR-payment solution for churches, zoos, museums, and nonprofits in the US market. We're building the sales infrastructure from scratch - so tell us what tools you've worked with and we'll set it up together.\n\r\n- Build and maintain lead lists (churches, zoos, museums, nonprofits across the US)\n\r\n- Set up and manage a CRM pipeline from zero (you recommend the tool, we d\n together)\n\r\n- Coordinate\n campaigns and follow-ups with our US Managing Partner\n\r\n- Prepare sales materials, proposals, and demo scheduling\n\r\n- Research target markets and verticals\n\r\nAs this grows, you'll hire sales support and manage them - so you need to understand the full sales cycle yourself first.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. VIETNAM & SOUTHEAST ASIA - Team Building\n\r\nWe are building a remote operations team in Southeast Asia (Vietnam and Philippines). You will help recruit, onboard, and coordinate.\n\r\n- Post job openings on local platforms (VietnamWorks, TopCV, TopDev, OnlineJobs.ph)\n\r\n- Screen candidates, conduct initial interviews, coordinate with CEO for final decisions\n\r\n- Set up daily standups, reporting, and project tracking (Slack, Notion, GitHub)\n\r\n- Act as the bridge between Austrian HQ and the Southeast Asian team\n\r\n- Help evaluate EOR providers and manage contractor compliance\n\r\nYou'll eventually hand off daily coordination to a local team lead - but first you need to build the processes and understand what good looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. E-COMMERCE BACKOFFICE & OPERATIONS\n\r\nOur European parent company operates multiple brands and marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, ManoMano, own webshops). A core priority from Day 1 is launching (or relaunching) our US marketplace channels - Amazon USA, eBay USA, and later Walmart.\n\r\n- Build, optimize, and launch product listings on Amazon, eBay, and Walmart US\n\r\n- Develop pricing strategies, fulfillment setup (FBA/FBM), and shipping logistics for the US market\n\r\n- Marketplace ticket management and customer communication\n\r\n- Order processing, supplier coordination, shipping tracking\n\r\n- EPR compliance tracking across European jurisdictions\n\r\n- Product data management and listing optimization\n\r\nOnce the channels run smoothly, you'll hire dedicated marketplace managers - but you need to have done it yourself to know what \"smooth\" looks like.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. AUTOMATION & DIGITAL TOOLS\n\r\nWe automate everything we can. You should be comfortable with modern tools.\n\r\n- Help build and maintain workflows in n8n (our automation platform)\n\r\n- Create reports, dashboards, and data summaries\n\r\n- Manage content calendars for LinkedIn and social media\n\r\n- Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) productively for content, research, and analysis\n\r\n- Document processes and create SOPs for repeatable tasks\n\r\n\n\r\n5. FINANCE & ACCOUNTING\n\r\nYou take ownership of the financial back office and make sure everything is clean, organized, and transparent.\n\r\n- Restructure and maintain the bookkeeping system across multiple entities (US and Europe)\n\r\n- Prepare and track invoices, credit notes, and payment reminders\n\r\n- Monitor incoming and outgoing payments, reconcile bank accounts\n\r\n- Coordinate with the external accountant and tax advisor (monthly closings, VAT filings, annual statements)\n\r\n- Prepare financial summaries and reports for the CEO\n\r\n- Track expenses, budgets, and profitability per channel and brand\n\r\n- Ensure compliance with local tax requirements across jurisdictions\n\r\n\n\r\n6. DIGITAL MARKETING & SOCIAL COMMERCE\n\r\nModern e-commerce doesn't work without strong digital presence. You'll build and manage our marketing channels.\n\r\n- LinkedIn content strategy and posting (for the CEO and company profiles)\n\r\n- TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube for product marketing and brand building\n\r\n- AI-generated content creation (using tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney for posts, videos, and ads)\n\r\n- Influencer marketing and AI influencer strategies\n\r\n-\n and Instagram Shopping integration\n\r\n-\n marketing and newsletter campaigns\n\r\n- SEO basics and performance tracking\n\r\n- Paid ads coordination (Google Ads, Meta Ads - working with specialists)\n\r\nYou don't need to be a full-time content creator - but you need to understand what works, set the strategy, and eventually hire specialists (content creators, video editors, ad managers) that you can properly manage and evaluate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO YOU ARE\n\r\n\n\r\nYour Personality:\n\r\nYou are the kind of person who opens their laptop in the morning and already knows what needs to happen today - without being told. You learn new tools over a weekend, not in a training program. When something breaks, you don't wait for instructions - you find a fix, implement it, and then report what you did. You thrive in fast-paced environments where no two days look the same.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're comfortable making decisions on your own in day-to-day operations (backoffice, tickets, scheduling), but you also know when to check in with the CEO on strategic calls (hiring decisions, client communication, new processes). You're not looking for a 9-to-5 routine - you want to build something and grow with it.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: THE COORDINATOR MINDSET\n\r\n\n\r\nLet's be clear about what this role really is. We don't expect you to be a world-class expert in every single area listed below. What we DO expect is that you've done enough of it yourself to truly understand how it works - the pain points, the shortcuts, the quality standards. Why? Because your real job is to build a team around you that handles the specialist work, and you need to be able to tell the difference between great work and garbage. You can only control what you understand. If you've never run an ad campaign, you can't evaluate someone who does it for you. If you've never reconciled a bank account, you won't catch mistakes. We need someone who has been in the trenches, understands the work, and can then hire, train, and manage the people who do it day-to-day. You don't need to be the best at everything - but you need to have done everything at least once.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Skills That Matter Most:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Fast Learner & Tech-Native (Most Important)\n\r\nThis is non-negotiable. Our stack changes, our tools evolve, and we move fast. You pick up a new platform in hours, not weeks. If someone shows you n8n or a new CRM, you're productive within days.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. High Capacity & Multitasking Under Pressure\n\r\nYou'll manage sales leads in the morning, screen a developer candidate in Southeast Asia before lunch, handle marketplace tickets in the afternoon, and prepare a report for the CEO by evening. You need to context-switch cleanly and keep quality high across all areas.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Professional Communication\n\r\nYou write\ns that clients and partners take seriously. Your English is flawless - not just grammatically correct, but professional, clear, and appropriate for business contexts in the US and Europe.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Initiative & Problem-Solving\n\r\nWhen you see a gap, you flag it - or better, you close it. You don't wait to be micromanaged. You suggest improvements, find better ways to do things, and take ownership of outcomes, not just tasks.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHARD SKILLS BY AREA\n\r\n\n\r\nUS Fintech Product / Sales Support:\n\r\n- CRM setup and management (tell us what you've used - we're building from scratch together) - Required\n\r\n-\n campaign setup and coordination - Required\n\r\n- Lead research and list building - Required\n\r\n- Sales material preparation (decks, proposals) - Nice to have\n\r\n- Understanding of payment processing / fintech - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nSoutheast Asia Team Building:\n\r\n- Experience posting jobs and screening candidates (Upwork, OnlineJobs.ph, VietnamWorks) - Required\n\r\n- Remote team coordination (Slack, Notion, daily standups) - Required\n\r\n- Experience managing or leading a remote team of 3+ people - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Knowledge of EOR/contractor compliance in Southeast Asia - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nE-Commerce Backoffice:\n\r\n- Marketplace operations (Amazon Seller Central, eBay) - Required\n\r\n- Experience launching or building marketplace channels from scratch - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Fulfillment knowledge (FBA, FBM, 3PL) - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Order management and customer service - Required\n\r\n- Product data management and listing optimization - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nAutomation & Digital Tools:\n\r\n- Google Workspace power user (Sheets, Docs, Drive) - Required\n\r\n- Experience with at least one automation tool (n8n, Zapier, Make) - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Comfortable using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) for content and automation - Required\n\r\n- Marketing automation \n sequences, social scheduling) - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nDigital Marketing & Social Commerce:\n\r\n- Experience managing social media accounts (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube) - Required\n\r\n- Content creation or coordination (posts, short videos, newsletters) - Required\n\r\n- Understanding of AI content tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Canva AI, etc.) - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Paid ads experience (Google Ads, Meta Ads) - Nice to have, can hire specialists\n\r\n- SEO basics and analytics (Google Analytics, Search Console) - Nice to have\n\r\n- Influencer outreach or partnership management - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\nFinance & Accounting:\n\r\n- Bookkeeping experience (invoicing, payment tracking, bank reconciliation) - Required\n\r\n- Experience coordinating with external accountants / tax advisors - Required\n\r\n- Understanding of multi-entity or multi-country financial structures - Strongly preferred\n\r\n- Proficiency in Excel/Google Sheets for financial reporting - Required\n\r\n- Knowledge of US and/or European VAT/sales tax basics - Nice to have\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR IDEAL BACKGROUND\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're the right person if you come from one of these paths:\n\r\n- Senior VA / Executive Assistant who managed operations for an e-commerce founder and is ready for a leadership role\n\r\n- E-commerce Operations Manager from a marketplace seller or D2C brand\n\r\n- BPO Team Lead / Project Manager who coordinated multiple clients or workstreams\n\r\n- Startup Operations Generalist who wore many hats and loved it\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS\n\r\n- Excellent English (written and spoken) - C1/C2 level\n\r\n- 3+ years of relevant professional experience\n\r\n- Available for 4+ hours daily overlap with Central European Time (CET / UTC+1)\n\r\n- Reliable high-speed internet and professional home office setup\n\r\n- Based in the Philippines or Vietnam\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR GROWTH PATH\n\r\n\n\r\nPhase 1 - Build the Foundation (Month 1-3)\n\r\nYou and the CEO launch (or relaunch) the US marketplace channels: Amazon USA and eBay USA go live with optimized listings, pricing, and fulfillment. A major priority in this phase is restructuring the entire bookkeeping and financial operations: cleaning up accounts, establishing clear processes for invoicing, payment tracking, and reporting, and setting up a reliable monthly closing workflow with the external accountant.

If you're looking for easy, low-stress work with flexible deadlines, this is not for you.\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me be direct about what you're signing up for.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO I AM\n\r\n\n\r\nI run multiple businesses simultaneously. I've hit capacity and need to delegate. I need someone who can take work OFF my plate—not add to it.\n\r\n\n\r\nI don't need someone who can \"help.\" I need someone who can EXECUTE.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE BRUTAL TRUTH ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me be upfront about the hard parts:\n\r\n\n\r\nMinimal hand-holding. You'll receive clear instructions and context for each task—but I won't walk you through every step. I'll give you the outcome I need. You figure out how to get there.\n\r\n\n\r\nEmergencies happen. If something critical breaks at 3am your time, we handle it. If a deadline is tomorrow, you stay up and get it done. This isn't every day, but when it happens, I need 100% reliability.\n\r\n\n\r\nDirect feedback. When you make mistakes (everyone does), I'll tell you directly. No sugarcoating. If you're the type who takes feedback personally instead of using it to improve, this won't work.\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh failure rate. If 10 people start a trial, expect 1-2 to make it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHY WOULD ANYONE WANT THIS JOB?\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what you get:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Direct access to a founder, not middle management.\n\r\nYou'll see how decisions are made at the top across multiple businesses. You'll learn by doing, not by watching.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Clear path to Executive Assistant ? Right-Hand Person.\n\r\nI'm not looking for a task-rabbit. I'm looking for someone who can eventually run things when I'm not around.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Trust and autonomy once earned.\n\r\nMicromanagement is exhausting for both of us. Prove yourself, and I'll give you the keys. I want to eventually hand off entire areas of responsibility—operating as my right hand, making decisions on my behalf.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Compensation grows with performance.\n\r\nStarting rate post-probation is $3/hr. Performance is rewarded—raises and bonuses are on the table as you take on more responsibility.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT I NEED FROM YOU\n\r\n\n\r\nNon-negotiables:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Minimum 2+ years VA experience (no exceptions—I don't have time to train basics)\n\r\n• Excellent written AND spoken English (you'll be coordinating with other Filipino freelancers on my team, and we'll work together via Zoom calls—all communication is in English)\n\r\n• Available for Zoom calls when needed (camera on, clear audio)\n\r\n• Reliable internet and backup plan if it goes down\n\r\n• Wise account for payments\n\r\n\n\r\nThe mindset I'm looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\n• You have a high work ethic and thrive on getting things done\n\r\n• You're career-first—this isn't a side gig\n\r\n• You take ownership. \"That's not my job\" isn't in your vocabulary\n\r\n• You're resourceful. AI is your friend. You solve problems before escalating\n\r\n• You can handle pressure without crumbling\n\r\n• You're direct. Shy and timid won't work here\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT YOU'LL BE DOING\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm in the middle of launching a startup. There's a mountain of tasks that need to get done, and I can't do them all myself. Your job is to take items off my plate and execute them.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis will vary week to week. Some examples:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Completing assignments and action items I delegate\n\r\n• Following up on tasks and keeping things moving\n\r\n• Organizing information, documents, and files\n\r\n• Communicating with tea\nmbers on my behalf\n\r\n• Handling whatever needs to get done to move the business forward\n\r\n\n\r\nThe work isn't predictable or repetitive. If you need a clearly defined job description with the same tasks every day, this isn't it.\n\r\n\n\r\nEventually (if you prove yourself):\n\r\n\n\r\n• Taking ownership of entire workstreams\n\r\n• Making decisions on my behalf\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCOMPENSATION & STRUCTURE\n\r\n\n\r\n• Position type: Part-time\n\r\n• Trial period: 2 weeks (fixed-fee per task)\n\r\n• Probation period: Up to 3 months after passing trial (fixed-fee per task)\n\r\n• Post-probation: Converted to hourly ($3/hr starting rate)\n\r\n• Advancement: Executive Assistant promotion available based on performance, with compensation to match\n\r\n• Timezone: PST\n\r\n• Payment: Wise, bi-weekly\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application via \n DM \n\r\n\n\r\nTo confirm you've read this entire post, begin your cover letter with: \"Time is the one resource we can't make more of.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that don't start with this phrase will be automatically rejected.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn your application, include:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Your resume/CV\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Answer these two questions:\n\r\n   • \"Describe a real situation where you handled an urgent, high-pressure task outside of normal working hours. What happened and what did you do?\"\n\r\n   • \"If I gave you a task with unclear instructions, what would you do?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Screenshot of your 16 Personalities test results: \n\r\n\n\r\n4. Screenshot of your DISC personality assessment results: \n\r\n\n\r\n5. Your Wise\n (for paid trial tasks if selected)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong applicants will be contacted for next steps, which may include an interview and paid trial assignments.

Explain the process you would set up so that you never have to type that answer manually in WhatsApp again. The fees are $200 USD per will. \n\r\n\n\r\nQuestion 3: \n\r\n\n\r\nHave you ever used tools like ChatGPT or Claude for work? What problem were you trying to solve, and how did you use the tool to solve it? Please be specific.                 ",

The trees change, the wind shifts, even the scent of the air reminds me of how long it’s been.

Every simple \nnt.\n\r\n\n\r\n(pauses, voice softening)\n\r\nI can still hear them. Their footsteps, their laughter, the way they argued over the smallest things. I thought those days would last forever. But forever… was only a blink for them.\n\r\n\n\r\n(more emotional, gentle)\n\r\nI wish I had said it earlier. “Thank you.” “Don’t leave so quickly.” “Stay just a little longer.” But I said nothing. I thought there would always be another day… another road to walk together. I was wrong.\n\r\n\n\r\n(looks up at the sky)\n\r\nBut even now, even after all these years… I’m still searching. Not for them—no. Their journey is long over. I’m searching for the meaning behind the time we shared. For the reason their short lives touched mine so deeply.\n\r\n\n\r\n(light smile)\n\r\nMaybe that’s what it means to live among humans. To learn, little by little, how precious each fleeting \nnt truly is. And to carry those \nnts with you, no matter how far you travel… or how long you remain.\n\r\n\n\r\n(whispers)\n\r\nI’m still walking, you know.

    "description": "\n                    The Mission: Drive Revenue, Not Just Traffic\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not hiring someone to “run ads” or “do tasks.”\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re hiring a growth partner to own the traffic, sales, and conversion strategy across three actively selling e-commerce stores.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must bring proof of scaling brands — from six to multiple six and seven figures — and have clear strategies that align with both paid traffic (Google, Meta, YouTube, etc.) and organic growth (SEO, content strategy, and conversion optimization).\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not your average Shopify store. We’re a fast-moving wellness brand with a signature product stack, a proven customer base, and a bold goal to hit $100K+/month revenue in the next 90 days.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will be given full strategic control of all inbound growth. This includes traffic generation, offer testing, sales tracking, landing page structure, funnel optimization, ad creative input, and ongoing reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere will be no hand-holding. This is a leadership role, not an assistant role.\n\r\n\n\r\n? Top 3 Skills you must have:\n\r\nSEO Strategy & Organic Revenue Growth\n\r\nGoogle Search Console & Technical SEO Analysis\n\r\nGEO / AI Search Optimization (SGE, AI Overviews, Entity SEO)\n\r\n\n\r\n???? You Must Be:\n\r\nA proven growth hacker for e-commerce, not just a media buyer\n\r\nStrategic and analytical, but not afraid to roll up your sleeves\n\r\nObsessed with conversions, ROAS, LTV, CPA, and testing offers\n\r\nFocused on what moves revenue, not vanity metrics\n\r\nAble to build and scale offers across multiple platforms\n\r\nComfortable running Meta Ads, Google Ads, and YouTube Ads\n\r\nKnowledgeable in\n flows, SEO, and funnel optimization\n\r\nHighly independent, reliable, and resourceful\n\r\n\n\r\n???? Requirements:\n\r\n4+ years of direct e-commerce growth experience (show proof)\n\r\nCase study or 2-minute Loom video showing e-commerce store(s) you've scaled (revenue results + backend data)\n\r\nStrong understanding of eCom KPIs: CAC, ROAS, LTV, CTR, CVR\n\r\nFamiliarity with Shopify/WooCommerce, Klaviyo, Meta Ads, Google Ads, and landing page builders\n\r\nSolid experience driving traffic organically + through paid campaigns\n\r\nUnderstanding of upsells, AOV, bundling, and offer strategy\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Read Before Applying\n\r\n\n\r\nSovereign Spirits Inc. operates in the peptide, health optimization, and weight release space, which often overlaps with gray market products. This includes research-use-only compounds, novel ingredients, and niche wellness products not broadly understood or accepted by mainstrea\ndia and ad platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs a result, our marketing requires advanced knowledge of compliance-safe copywriting, funnel strategy, platform-specific ad policies, and indirect persuasion tactics. If you're not already familiar with working around restricted ad categories, gray-area supplements, or platform workarounds (e.g., running native,\n, SEO, or third-party traffic instead of Meta/Google ads alone), this is NOT the right fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe do not promote illegal or unsafe products. But due to public and regulatory misunderstanding of peptides and gray-market wellness compounds, we often face restrictions and ad rejections. Our success depends on clever, strategic, and ethical marketing that respects platform policies while still converting.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease do not apply unless:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are comfortable working in non-mainstream wellness spaces\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ve navigated compliance-heavy industries (CBD, crypto, nootropics, hormone support, biohacking, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re resourceful, creative, and okay with testing stealthy but ethical strategies\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have a solid understanding of conversion psychology and customer journey building outside of standard ad platforms\n\r\n\n\r\nMonthly Retainer + Performance Bonus Opportunity\n\r\nLocation: Remote\n\r\nEmployment Type: Full-Time (Contract-to-Hire)                ",
