    "description": "\n                    Growth Strategist- Application Form \n\r\nRemote, European Time Zone\n\r\nI built this agency because I was excited about growing brands. Whilst others focus on ROAS and platfor\ntrics. \n\r\nWe exist to guide brands through growth. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe hire people who want to understand why a brand’s margin is collapsing, not just how to get their ROAS UP. If you’re the kind of person who asks about the business before you look at the ad account, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role exists because I need someone who can sit in front of a founder, understand their P&L better than they do, and tell them the truth about what’s actually going to grow their business, even when that truth is uncomfortable.\n\r\n— Andy Gray, Founder & CEO\n\r\nWho We Are\n\r\nWe’re not media buyers. We’re Performance Scientists.\n\r\nThe Graygency works with 7-8 figure DTC e-commerce brands across the UK, US, and UAE. While other agencies are chasing ROAS and vanity metrics, we’re in the P&L  pulling apart unit economics, contribution margins, and the commercial levers that actually drive profitable growth.\n\r\nFor most of our clients, we’re not just managing their ads. We’re operating as their growth team, , building the commercial roadmap and growth strategy. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe then execute True Performance across the paid media platforms.\n\r\nWe’re also building this differently. AI-assisted analysis, automated reporting, custom tooling, we're replacing the busywork with technology so our people can focus on the thinking that actually moves the needle.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nThis is a commercially-focused growth strategist position for someone who understands that growing a DTC brand is about way more than optimisation. It's about understanding the entire business model and having the backbone to tell founders the hard truth when their expectations are unrealistic, their product positioning is broken, or their spend allocation makes no sense.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not an account management role. This is not a media buyer role.\n\r\n\n\r\nReports directly to the CEO. Part of the senior leadership team. The kind of role where you shape the agency, not just work in it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You’ll Actually Do\n\r\nOwn Strategy Across a Tiered Portfolio\n\r\nLet’s be real, not every account needs the same level of strategic input, and pretending otherwise burns people out. You’ll build the framework for how we tier and serve clients:\n\r\nFull growth strategy for our highest-value accounts. You’re in the room with the founder, setting the direction, challenging assumptions, building the commercial roadmap.\n\r\nConsult and coach on mid-tier accounts alongside our platform specialists. You’re guiding, not doing.\n\r\nLight-touch oversight on execution-focused accounts. Quick check-ins, flag issues, keep it moving.\n\r\nDrive Commercial Outcomes\n\r\nUnderstand every brand’s P&L: COGS, contribution margins, fixed costs, shipping economics, payback periods. Not as a nice-to-have  as the foundation for everything you recommend.\n\r\nWork with our internal forecasting tools to develop financial models and forecasts that actually inform decisions, not just fill slides.\n\r\nMake strategic recommendations on pricing, product positioning, and placement, not just media tactics.\n\r\nTell founders the truth. If their ROAS expectations are insane, their product positioning is off, or they’re spending 80% of their budget on existing customers and wondering why growth has stalled, you say it. With data. With credibility. Without losing the relationship.\n\r\nOwn Data & Reporting Quality\n\r\nQA reporting infrastructure, pacing docs, and budget trackers. You won’t build every report, but when something’s off, you catch it before the client does.\n\r\nWork with automated reporting tools (GoMarble,Internal measurement tools, custom dashboards) and understand their limitations.\n\r\nBe hands-on enough to pull your own numbers fro\nta, Google, Shopify, or our reporting stack. If you need someone else to pull data before you can think, this isn’t the right fit.\n\r\nDevelop the Team\n\r\nLead a cross-functional team including paid social, PPC, creative strategy, and execs.\n\r\nSet the standard. Hold people accountable. Be the person the team goes to when they need strategic clarity.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNon-Negotiables\n\r\nGrowth Track Record\n\r\n5-7 years in e-commerce marketing preferably with both agency and in-house experience. Agency for the pace and multi-account muscle. In-house for the commercial depth. We need both.\n\r\nSpecific, provable numbers. “Scaled Brand from X to Y over 18 months.” Not “worked on high-profile accounts.”\n\r\nYou’ve built growth engines, not just maintained someone else’s.\n\r\nWe want \n\r\nCommercial & Financial Acumen\n\r\nDeep understanding of e-commerce unit economics: COGS, contribution margin, LTV:CAC, payback periods.\n\r\nYou’ve built financial models for scenario planning. Not used someone else’s template  built them.\n\r\nYou can have a serious conversation with a founder about their business model, not just their ad account.\n\r\nData Literacy\n\r\nYou can build and maintain reporting infrastructure. Google Sheets, Looker Studio, or equivalent.\n\r\nYou QA data instinctively. Pacing docs, budget trackers, attribution data  you catch what’s off.\n\r\nYou pull your own numbers. You don’t wait for a deck.\n\r\nBackbone\n\r\nYou’ve delivered hard truths to founders  on pricing, product, expectations, spend allocation  and kept the relationship. This isn’t optional. Half the job is telling smart people things they don’t want to hear.\n\r\nYou build trust through commercial credibility and strategic clarity, not by being nice.\n\r\nYou handle the code-switching of agency life  subscription supplement brand in the morning, luxury fashion in the afternoon  without dropping context.\n\r\nPlatform Knowledge\n\r\nStrong understanding of Meta and Google platform dynamics. You’re not building campaigns, but you know exactly what good looks like and you can QA what the team produces.\n\r\nTeam Leadership\n\r\nManaged 2-3 direct reports and directed 5-10 cross-functionally.\n\r\nEnergised by developing junior talent. If mentoring smart specialists into strategists feels like a burden rather than a privilege, this isn’t the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Would Make You Stand Out\n\r\nMultiple e-commerce verticals, not just one category.\n\r\nBrands at different stages: early growth, scaling, mature.\n\r\nBackground in consulting, analytics, or finance before moving into marketing.\n\r\nBuilt proprietary frameworks, tools, or measurement systems.\n\r\nInternational expansion or multi-market experience.\n\r\nOpinions on how AI and automation multiply strategic impact. We’re building with GoMarble, MCP servers, Claude, and custom alerting. You should be excited by that, not threatened.\n\r\n\n\r\nRed Flags\n\r\nAccount managers who are great at relationships but can’t show growth numbers.\n\r\nMedia buyers who only think in platform tactics.\n\r\nPeople who’ve only worked on mature, high-spend brands in maintenance mode.\n\r\nAnyone who jumps to tactics before asking diagnostic questions.\n\r\nPeople-pleasers who avoid hard conversations to keep things comfortable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nReports directly to the CEO. Part of senior leadership.\n\r\nGenuine autonomy to build and lead your function.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a chance to shape a growing agency during a pivotal \nnt. Work with ambitious 7-8 figure DTC brands. Build systems that scale. Be part of redefining what a performance marketing agency looks like when it’s built around commercial thinking and technology, not just ad accounts and decks.\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease apply through the following link: \n\r\n\n                ",

Small senior team, fast-moving, zero bureaucracy.\n\r\nHours and Schedule\n\r\nMust overlap US business hours. Remote/work from home. Start part-time with clear path to full-time based on performance.\n\r\nWhat This Role Actually Is\n\r\nYou will own, build, debug, and improve production n8n workflows that are not simple automations. These are large-scale AI agent systems with 100+ nodes including LLM chains, Postgres chat memory, multi-channel message routing, webhook orchestration, CRM integrations, and heavy JavaScript code nodes. You need to look at a workflow like this and immediately understand what it does, where it can break, and how to make it better.\n\r\nYou will also read API documentation for platforms we integrate with (EMR systems like 4D, CRM platforms like GoHighLevel, booking systems, payment processors) and build new API connections fast. We expect you to use AI tools like Claude to accelerate your work. If you are not already using AI to code faster, this is not the right role.\n\r\nWhat You Will Do\n\r\nBuild and maintain complex n8n workflows from scratch including AI agent nodes, conditional routing, webhook handling, code nodes with JavaScript, HTTP request chains, and error handling across multi-step processes.\n\r\nRead and implement API integrations from documentation. When we get access to a new API like a medical records system or booking platform, you figure out the endpoints, authentication, data mapping, and build the n8n integration or standalone connector.\n\r\nDebug production workflows. When something breaks at 2am and a clinic is not getting their AI responses, you trace the issue through webhook logs, node executions, API responses, and fix it.\n\r\nWrite and maintain JavaScript code nodes that handle data transformation, message routing, prompt building, contact enrichment, and output processing within n8n workflows.\n\r\nWork with our AI models. Understand how Anthropic Claude and Google Gemini are configured in n8n agent nodes, how chat memory works with Postgres, how prompts are built dynamically, and how to tune these for better results.\n\r\nCoordinate with the team. You work independently but communicate clearly. When you find a problem or finish a build, you document it and share it.\n\r\nMust-Haves (No Exceptions)\n\r\nProven n8n experience with complex workflows. Not 5-node automations. You must have built or maintained workflows with 50+ nodes including code nodes, HTTP requests, webhooks, conditional logic, and error handling. Show us examples.\n\r\nStrong JavaScript skills. You will read, write, and debug JavaScript daily inside n8n code nodes. You must be comfortable with async operations, JSON manipulation, API response parsing, and data transformation.\n\r\nAPI integration experience. You have connected systems by reading API docs, handling authentication (OAuth, API keys, bearer tokens), parsing responses, and mapping data between platforms. REST APIs and JSON are second nature to you.\n\r\nExperience coding with AI. You actively use Claude, ChatGPT, or similar tools to write and debug code faster. You understand prompt engineering well enough to get accurate code output and know how to verify and fix what AI generates.\n\r\nGit and GitHub. You use version control. You can clone repos, create branches, commit, push, and handle pull requests. This is mandatory.\n\r\nPython literacy. You can read Python code, understand Python scripts, and make basic modifications. We are moving some systems to FastAPI and you need to follow along.\n\r\nProblem-solving mindset. When something breaks you do not wait for someone to tell you what to do. You investigate, trace the issue, test solutions, and fix it.\n\r\nGood written and verbal English. You will communicate with the team daily and occasionally with clients.\n\r\nStrong Preferences (Big Plus)\n\r\nDocker experience. Understanding containers, docker-compose, how to deploy and update containerized services.\n\r\nServer management basics. Comfortable with Linux servers, SSH, updating services, checking logs, restarting processes. We run on Digital Ocean and Hetzner.\n\r\nVercel and/or Render experience. We deploy frontend and some backend services on these platforms.\n\r\nFastAPI knowledge. We are converting some n8n workflows to FastAPI microservices. If you can already build FastAPI endpoints, that is a major advantage.\n\r\nGoHighLevel experience. Many of our workflows integrate heavily with GHL including contacts, conversations, opportunities, calendars, and custom webhooks.\n\r\nHealthcare or clinic automation experience. Understanding HIPAA basics, patient data handling, appointment booking flows.\n\r\nPostgres database experience. Our chat memory and data storage runs on Postgres.\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like in 30 to 60 Days\n\r\nYou have taken ownership of at least 2 to 3 production client workflows and can maintain them independently. You have built at least one new API integration from documentation. You have improved existing workflows with better error handling, cleaner code nodes, or performance optimizations. You have documented your work so the team can follow it.\n\r\nHow We Work\n\r\nWe use n8n self-hosted for workflow automation, GitHub for version control, ClickUp for project management, Slack for communication. Our AI stack includes Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and OpenAI models. We integrate with GoHighLevel, Symplast, 4D EMR, HealthEngine, Google services, Twilio, and various other platforms via API.\n\r\nWhat to Include in Your Application (Show Do Not Tell)\n\r\nLinks to n8n workflow examples or screenshots of complex workflows you have built. Redact sensitive information.\n\r\nYour GitHub profile. We want to see real code, not empty repos.\n\r\nA short description of the most complex API integration you have built and how you approached it.\n\r\nWhich AI tools you use for coding and a specific example of how AI helped you solve a problem faster.\n\r\nYour hourly rate or monthly retainer expectation, US hours you can cover, and earliest start date.

From firefighters, to law firms, to suppliers sending life-saving food to kids dying of malnutrition, the code you write will help make the world a better place.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur team is made up of people who want to do the best work of their life. People who love to learn, challenge themselves, grow and have some fun along the journey. We also care about each other – we support each other in our own personal goals and vision. We are human beings before employees and we love to bring out the best in each other.\n\r\n\n\r\nNow, ready to learn more about this opening? Buckle up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here, you’ll be:\n\r\n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\n\r\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\n\r\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\n\r\n- Help expand our codebase and tools, participate in code reviews, and grow with your fellow developers.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll do well in this job if you:\n\r\n- Have a strong background in Python and understand HTML, CSS and Javascript enough to be dangerous.\n\r\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\n\r\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building.\n\r\n- Are familiar with common things we deal with as developers: Git, SQLAlchemy, building and engaging with APIs, linters, etc.\n\r\n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\n\r\n- Are attentive to details.\n\r\n- Have 3+ years of Python development experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably shouldn’t apply if:\n\r\n- You’re “just looking for extra money.”\n\r\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work.\n\r\n- You get offended easily and take things personally.\n\r\n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\n\r\n- You get overwhelmed easily with new code, new habits, new learnings and chat messages.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe interview process:\n\r\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don’t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via\n. (With lots of questions, sprinkled with a few voice notes)\n\r\n- You may be able to speak with a developer or two on our team to see how they like the role.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here:\n\r\n- You’ll get 13th month salary, Filipino holidays, unlimited time off (we don’t count sick days), a normal working day schedule (no night shifts, although an early start is preferred for time overlap) with some flexibility, a week off during the holidays in December, and the opportunity to grow and become your best self.\n\r\n\n\r\nA little more about us:\n\r\n- We’ve been in business for a decade+. Our teams are remote (mostly in the Philippines). Our longest standing tea\nmber has been with us for over 13+ years. We've had people quit smoking on our teams with our help, lose weight, learn a new instrument, speak a new language, and more. We all love what we do.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to begin\n\r\n- Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to send us an\n with 3 questions you have about this role. If you’re currently in a full-time role and are looking for something new, we’re open to a transition window. We actually care about your happiness.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: While we like AI, and we use it in certain circumstances, we ask that no AI be used during communication. Communication is the most important thing we do. If I don't see your natural voice from our first interaction, then you're setting an inaccurate representation of who you are and how you communicate. And when I see that change, it's going to come across as a lack of harmony in how you communicate.                ",

Buckle up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here, you’ll be: \n\r\n- Challenged to do the best work of your life in a supportive environment.\n\r\n- Become the best communicator you can become (this is the most important thing we do).\n\r\n- Have the space to ask questions, voice your feedback and make a difference (and be yourself).\n\r\n- Help expand our codebase and tools, participate in code reviews, and grow with your fellow developers. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll do well in this job if you:\n\r\n- Have a strong background in Python and understand HTML, CSS and Javascript enough to be dangerous.\n\r\n- Enjoy working with people who actually care about what they do and will not let you be lazy or do sloppy work.\n\r\n- Have an opinion and care about best practices and love learning and creating and building. \n\r\n- Are familiar with common things we deal with as developers: Git, SQLAlchemy, building and engaging with APIs, linters, etc. \n\r\n- Have grit and determination and are someone who will exceed no matter what gets in your way.\n\r\n- Are attentive to details.\n\r\n- Have 3+ years of Python development experience. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou probably shouldn’t apply if:\n\r\n- You’re “just looking for extra money.”\n\r\n- You like working 5 full-time jobs because all you care about is work. \n\r\n- You get offended easily and take things personally. \n\r\n- You are not someone with grit and determination who can persevere while being challenged to do great work.\n\r\n- You get overwhelmed easily with new code, new habits, new learnings and chat messages. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe interview process:\n\r\n- Since 99% of our work is done via Slack (we don’t do scheduled calls), the entire interview process will be via\n. (With lots of questions, sprinkled with a few voice notes)\n\r\n- You may be able to speak with a developer or two on our team to see how they like the role. \n\r\n\n\r\nIf you work here:\n\r\n- You’ll get 13th month salary, Filipino holidays, unlimited time off (we don’t count sick days), a normal working day schedule (no night shifts, although an early start is preferred for time overlap) with some flexibility, a week off during the holidays in December, and the opportunity to grow and become your best self. \n\r\n\n\r\nA little more about us:\n\r\n- We’ve been in business for a decade+. Our teams are remote (mostly in the Philippines). Our longest standing tea\nmber has been with us for over 13+ years. We've had people quit smoking on our teams with our help, lose weight, learn a new instrument, speak a new language, and more. We all love what we do. \n\r\n\n\r\nHow to begin\n\r\n- Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to send us an\n with 3 questions you have about this role. If you’re currently in a full-time role and are looking for something new, we’re open to a transition window. We actually care about your happiness.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: While we like AI, and we use it in certain circumstances, we ask that no AI be used during communication. Communication is the most important thing we do. If I don't see your natural voice from our first interaction, then you're setting an inaccurate representation of who you are and how you communicate. And when I see that change, it's going to come across as a lack of harmony in how you communicate.                ",

    "description": "\n                    Kamusta po! I am Jon, an American travel vlogger with a total following of over 900,000 across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and\n. I’m currently building a small in-house team located near Pasig to join me on my travels and help with recording, editing, and many other parts of the content creation process. My goal is to build something that feels less like a traditional job and more like a close-knit team that grows and travels together.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’ll start by focusing on localized short form content around 20-70 seconds long with minimal editing (mainly jump cuts and occasional blur effects). These videos usually take about an hour from start to finish, so we’ll aim for around 3-6 unique videos a day to repost across 8 different social media channels. Afterwards, we’ll begin to branch into long form content as we prepare for the first set of longer travels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not need to have a lot of experience in content creation, and it’s totally okay if you’re shy around cameras. I was the same way when I first started making videos too. I’ll be working closely with you and teaching you everything step by step — all I ask is that you’re open-minded, willing to learn, and excited to grow with the team long-term.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThere will be a 3-part interview process:\n\r\n1. Online Conversation – We’ll start by chatting here or on Google Chat to clear up any misunderstandings and to begin learning more about each other.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Video Call – Just a casual call to see if we get along. (Background noise like chickens, jeepneys, or karaoke is totally fine — I’ve been living in the Philippines for over a year now, so I’m used to it)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. In-Person Meet-Up & Casual Recording – We’ll meet up and do a short, relaxed recording together to see how our personalities work in real time. (Nothing scripted — just natural conversation)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf all 3 parts go well and both of us want to proceed, we will then spend around 2 weeks working closely together for training, building a workflow, and preparing for upcoming trips. During our travels, I will cover the costs for food, housing, transportation, and general travel expenses. In addition, each tea\nmber will receive a direct percentage of my top-performing channel’s revenues. This is paid work, and all details will be discussed transparently during the interview process.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIn conclusion, I’m looking for people who want to:\n\r\n- Join me on my travels\n\r\n- Help with all parts of the content creation process\n\r\n- Grow together as a team\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat’s included:\n\r\n- Paid role (revenue share from my top-performing channels)\n\r\n- Food, housing, and travel expenses covered during trips\n\r\n- Connections with brands and sponsors\n\r\n- Hands-on training and real-world experience\n\r\n- Opportunity to grow long-term with the team\n\r\n\n\r\nInterview process:\n\r\n- Short online chat\n\r\n- Casual video call to see if we get along\n\r\n- In-person meet-up with a short, relaxed recording (nothing scripted — just natural conversation)\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n- Open to learning new skills\n\r\n-  Positive, team-first attitude\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (not required):\n\r\n- Video editing experience\n\r\n- Social media experience\n\r\n- Located near Pasig\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like something you’d be interested in, send me a message and answer this question:\n\r\n- If we were traveling together and just finished filming all day, what would you do to relax?\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this — I’m really looking forward to building something incredible together as we travel, create, and entertain the world!\n\r\n\n\r\n- Jon                ",
