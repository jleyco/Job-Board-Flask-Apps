The site is built around a published book covering 68 scientifically-validated natural therapies, supported by a blog with articles grounded in medical research (PubMed, nephrology journals, etc.).\n\r\nI'm a full-time professional based in Sydney, Australia, with limited availability. I need someone who can own the operational side of this website completely — not someone who waits for instructions on every small task.\n\r\nThis is a long-term role. If you're good and the site grows (which is the plan), your hours and pay grow with it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nIn the first 30 days, your priorities will be:\n\r\n\n\r\nInstalling and configuring WordPress plugins (Google Analytics 4 via Site Kit, Search Console, RankMath SEO, ConvertKit, Pretty Links, Hotjar, UpdraftPlus)\n\r\nSetting up\n opt-in forms and a welcome\n sequence in ConvertKit/MailerLite\n\r\nAuditing all existing blog articles against a Google EEAT compliance checklist I'll provide\n\r\nRevising articles using Claude AI (I'll give you a prompt template) to improve citations, author authority signals, and trustworthiness markers\n\r\nSetting up affiliate links for health supplements (iHerb, Amazon Associates) using Pretty Links\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter the first month, your ongoing responsibilities will include:\n\r\n\n\r\nPublishing 2-3 SEO-optimised blog articles per week (you research and write drafts; I review and approve)\n\r\nBuilding and managing a monthly keyword content calendar using Ubersuggest or similar\n\r\nManaging\n broadcasts and the monthly community newsletter draft\n\r\nMonitoring GA4 and Search Console and sending me a brief weekly summary (what's ranking, what's growing, what needs attention)\n\r\nMaintaining affiliate link accuracy and adding new affiliate opportunities as they arise\n\r\nLight Canva work for blog images and product mockups\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're The Right Person If:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have at least 2 years of hands-on WordPress experience (not just \"I've used it\" — you know plugins, themes, settings, and can troubleshoot basic issues without Googling for 3 hours)\n\r\nYou have done SEO content work before and understand what keyword research, meta descriptions, and internal linking actually mean in practice\n\r\nYou're comfortable using AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to assist with content drafting and revision — you don't need to be an expert, but you can't be afraid of it\n\r\nYou have worked on a health, wellness, or medical-adjacent website before (not required, but a significant advantage)\n\r\nYou can work with minimal supervision — I'll give you clear deliverables and deadlines, but I won't micromanage daily tasks\n\r\nYou're based in the Philippines and available for a short weekly check-in call (30 min, Sydney time — flexible on exact timing)\n\r\nYour written English is excellent. Health content requires precision — vague or sloppy writing won't work here\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're NOT The Right Person If:\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need constant hand-holding or daily check-ins to stay on track\n\r\nYou've never managed affiliate links or worked with monetised content before\n\r\nYou apply to every job on this platform without reading the post (see application instructions below)\n\r\nYou're looking for short-term or project-only work\n\r\n\n\r\nHours & Compensation\n\r\n\n\r\nStart: 20 hours/week\n\r\nRate: $5 USD/hour depending on experience (open to negotiation for the right candidate)\n\r\nPaid weekly via Wise or Payoneer\n\r\nHours can increase to 30-40/week within 3-6 months as the project scales\n\r\n\n\r\nTools You'll Be Using\n\r\nWordPress, RankMath, ConvertKit or MailerLite, Pretty Links, Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, Ubersuggest, Canva, Claude AI, Gumroad, Google Docs/Sheets, Notion (for task tracking)\n\r\n\n\r\nHow To Apply\n\r\nTo filter serious applicants: begin your application message with the phrase \"Kidney Health VA\" followed by your answer to this question:\n\r\n\"Describe one specific thing you would check or fix on a health blog article to improve its Google EEAT score. Be specific — not general.\"\n\r\nThen include:\n\r\n\n\r\nA brief overview of your most relevant experience (2-3 paragraphs)\n\r\nLinks to any WordPress sites you've worked on (even if you just managed them — I'm not looking for designers)\n\r\nYour availability and timezone\n\r\nYour motivation (or story) for the role\n\r\n\n\r\nApplications that don't follow these instructions will not be read. This isn't being harsh — it's how I know you pay attention to detail, which is the most important quality for this role.\n\r\n\n\r\nOne More Thing\n\r\nThis website is about a topic that matters — helping people with serious kidney disease find affordable, evidence-based options outside the standard clinical pathway. I want someone who finds that work meaningful, not just someone filling hours. If that resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you. If anyone of your family or friends is suffering from chronic diseases, and if you are going deep into clinical research to help him or her, include that in the \"Your motivation (or story) for the role\" section.\n\r\n\n\r\nNOTE: Applications must be handwritten — AI-generated responses will be filtered out. The role itself heavily involves AI tools including Claude, so comfort with AI is required                ",

We hire people who are smart, ambitious, and have a strong desire to learn and grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nSound like you? This is an exciting long-term opportunity!\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a fully remote position. You’ll work directly with our founders and collaborate with our small but mighty team to support customer happiness, streamline operations, and take on projects that help the business grow. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a foundational role — one where you’ll gain visibility into all parts of the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you grow, your role will grow with you, based on your interests and strengths:\n\r\n• Want to work improving our systems and processes? Awesome!\n\r\n• Have ideas on how to improve our website? Fantastic!\n\r\n• Want to learn how to manage projects? Let’s go!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not just hiring for a role — we’re hiring for potential. \n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibilities will span 4 key areas: customer experience (30-40%), operations/logistics (20-30%), executive support (10-20%), and special projects (10-20%) — giving you exposure across the business. These percentages are estimates and you can expect your day-to-day to shift and evolve as the business grows and as you take ownership. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Customer Experience\n\r\n• Provide\n/chat-based support for our customers across our channels (Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale)\n\r\n• Answer order and product questions, resolve issues promptly, and ensure customers feel heard and supported\n\r\n• Support wholesale partners with order updates, invoicing, and coordination\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

This role evolves — as you grow, so will your responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / REQUIRED SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE:\n\r\nWe value curiosity, reliability, and the ability to take ownership. If you enjoy figuring things out, learning on the job, and taking initiative, you’ll thrive here. This role is not a fit if you need constant direction or struggle to manage your own time.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have experience:\n\r\n• 2+ years of experience in a customer service or operations support role \n/chat-based)\n\r\n• 1+ years experience in eCommerce environments (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)\n\r\n• Fluent in written and spoken English\n\r\n\n\r\nKey traits:\n\r\n• Strong detail orientation, organizational, and time-management skills — you’re detail-obsessed and on top of things\n\r\n• Proactive problem-solver — you take initiative, do the research, and follow through\n\r\n• Able to work independently, ask questions when needed, and communicate clearly\n\r\n• Comfortable with constructive feedback and direct, respectful communication\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional but a big plus:\n\r\n• Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus\n\r\n• Experience with executive assistant work \n/calendar/travel management)\n\r\n• Experience improving or documenting processes (SOPs)\n\r\n• Experience at a startup or small business where you wore multiple hats\n\r\n• “Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY, WORKING HOURS, HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nIf this description seems like it’s too intimidating for you, this position is probably not for you. However, if you’re still here reading and this sounds exciting for you, we’d love to meet you!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe full time monthly salary will be $\nbased on your skills and level of relevant experience. Being a member of our team has other benefits including up to 16 days of paid time off per year.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our interview process extremely quick and efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1.

Link to your GitHub or code portfolio — Show us real Swift code.\n\r\n2. Link to at least one app you've built — App Store link, TestFlight, video walkthrough, or screenshots. We want to see what you've shipped.\n\r\n3. A brief note on how you use AI coding tools — Which ones, and how they fit into your workflow. If you don't use them yet, just say so.\n\r\n4. Your expected hourly rate in USD.\n\r\n\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\n\r\nWe're building a mobile app that's going to change how people learn poker — and we need a Swift developer who can ship.\n\r\nStack is a mobile-first poker education app. Think Duolingo meets \n. Bite-sized lessons, gamification, streaks, leaderboards — all wrapped in a sleek dark UI that feels like a premium product.\n\r\nThe designs are coming. The content is built. We need someone who can take a PRD and polished layouts and turn them into a real, shipped iOS app — fast.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're a Swift developer who moves quickly, makes smart decisions, and doesn't need hand-holding — this might be the best role you find this year.\n\r\n\n\r\nWHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?\n\r\n- Build a real product from the ground up — You're not maintaining legacy code. You're building a brand new app that a massive audience is waiting for.\n\r\n- Consistent, reliable pay — We have NEVER missed a payment. We also offer performance bonuses for exceptional work.\n\r\n- Work with a growing brand — Stack is backed \n a poker brand with 200K+ followers on Instagram. The audience is built. The content is ready. We need the app.\n\r\n- AI-forward team — We use Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex heavily. If AI tools are already part of your workflow, you'll feel right at home.\n\r\n- Room to grow — Start with the core app build. High performers take on more ownership, architecture decisions, and leadership as we scale.\n\r\n- Be treated right — Direct access to the founders, open communication, fast feedback loops, and a team that respects your time and talent.\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\nYou'll be working directly with our co-founder to build Stack's iOS app from designs and PRDs.\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary (Day 1):\n\r\nBuild and ship iOS app screens from Figma designs and PRDs\n\r\nImplement the core lesson/quiz engine (multiple question types, scoring, progression)\n\r\nIntegrate Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging)\n\r\nBuild real-time features using WebSocket where needed\n\r\nImplement push notifications and streak/engagement triggers\n\r\nWrite Cloud Functions for server-side logic\n\r\nHandle animations, transitions, and micro-interactions that make the app feel polished\n\r\nMake smart calls on edge cases, error states, and UX polish without being told every detail\n\r\n\n\r\nAs You Grow:\n\r\n\n\r\nContribute to architecture decisions and technical planning\n\r\nOptimize performance and app size\n\r\nImplement analytics and tracking\n\r\nApp Store submission and release management\n\r\nHelp onboard additional developers as the team grows\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US\n\r\nStack — A mobile-first poker training app that combines Duolingo-style daily learning with competitive gamification. 5 courses, 44 lessons, 475+ questions — all designed and ready to build.

We just need to ship.\n\r\nWe're a small, fast-moving team. No bureaucracy, no pointless meetings, no Jira tickets for the sake of Jira tickets. You'll get clear direction, good designs, and the freedom to build.\n\r\n\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\n\r\nMust-Haves:\n\r\nSwift is your primary language — This is non-negotiable. We need someone who dreams in Swift, not someone who \"can also do iOS.\"\n\r\nExperience shipping iOS apps — You've built apps that real people use. Show us what you've shipped.\n\r\nFirebase proficiency — Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions, Messaging. You've worked with this stack before.\n\r\nYou ship fast and make good decisions — You'll get a PRD and designs.

This role combines guest relations, reservation management, and administrative tasks to ensure seamless service and operational accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n- This is NOT a generic support role.\n\r\n- You’ll be juggling guests, cleaners, and maintenance teams in real time — often with imperfect information and real consequences if poor decisions are made. Because of that, our hiring process is intentionally more challenging than a typical “message responder” position.\n\r\n- The assessment you’re about to take is designed to understand how you think — how you prioritize, communicate, and make judgment calls when there isn’t one obvious right answer.\n\r\n- If you enjoy solving realistic scenarios, thinking critically, and taking ownership, you will likely enjoy both this assessment and the job itself. If you are looking for a simple, scripted support role, this probably won’t be the right fit — and that’s okay.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\nGuest Communications & Support\n\r\n- Respond promptly and professionally to booking inquiries, guest messages, and support requests across multiple platforms.\n\r\n- Provide phone support to address urgent guest needs and ensure timely issue resolution.\n\r\n- Collaborate with the operations team to facilitate smooth check-ins, check-outs, and overall guest satisfaction.\n\r\n\n\r\nOperational & Administrative Support\n\r\n- Perform booking cleanup, ensuring reservations are accurate and conflicts are resolved.\n\r\n- Conduct guest cleanup by maintaining accurate records and organizing guest profiles.\n\r\n- Manage listing accuracy and resolve platform-related issues across Airbnb, \n, Expedia, etc.\n\r\n- Support accounting functions, including expense tracking, invoice updates, and discrepancy reporting.\n\r\n- Assist in lead management, including organizing, qualifying, and supporting follow-up efforts for potential property acquisition opportunities.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n- Experience with short-term rental platforms (Airbnb, \n, Vrbo, etc.).\n\r\n- Strong communication skills and professional phone etiquette.\n\r\n- Detail-oriented with strong organizational abilities.\n\r\n-Tech-savvy and able to work independently during overnight shifts.\n\r\n- PREFERRED: Experience with PriceLabs, Beds24, accounting tasks, or lead management.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nUpload your resume here >>> \n/s/5sal0p7n                ",

We work with major brands and premium salons, and our philosophy is simple: don't be boring. Everything we produce from code to creative needs to meet a premium standard.\n\r\nWe're a small, tight team that moves fast. You'll be working directly with the founder (who has a technical background in software engineering) and alongside our Ops & Automation Engineer and Art Director.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe're looking for a senior web developer with strong design sensibility to own our web properties - primarily client websites on WordPress and Shopify, and Framer.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a pure execution role. We need someone who can look at a design and implement it perfectly, but also someone who can take a rough brief and build something that looks and feels premium without needing their hand held. You should be as comfortable in PHP and server config as you are in CSS and animations.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll start part time (30 hours/week). For the right person, this role grows into a technical full time lead position. This is someone who doesn't just build, but thinks architecturally, contributes to infrastructure decisions, and becomes a true engineering partner.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\r\nCore Responsibilities (Day One)\n\r\nFrontend & Design Implementation\n\r\n\n\r\nImplementing designs from our Art Director, translating Figma/design files into responsive websites\n\r\nFrontend animations and interactions, CSS animations, GSAP, scroll effects, loaders.

You don't just build what you're told; you notice when something looks off and fix it\n\r\nWordPress expertise, custom theme development, ACF (Advanced Custom Fields), flexible content, custom blocks, PHP templating. You build modular, reusable components not one off sections that can't be repurposed\n\r\nPHP proficiency comfortable writing custom backend logic, not just installing plugins\n\r\nShopify Liquid comfortable with theme architecture, sections, templates\n\r\nModern CSS/SCSS responsive design, animations, transitions, grid, flexbox\n\r\nJavaScript vanilla JS, DOM manipulation, some framework experience is a plus\n\r\nServer management comfortable with hosting environments, SSH, staging setups, DNS, basic server troubleshooting\n\r\nSecurity awareness SSL, WordPress hardening, malware scanning, keeping things locked down\n\r\nGit proficiency branching, merging, pull requests, code review. Not just committing to main\n\r\nAI coding tools this is critical. We expect you to use Claude Code, Cursor, or similar AI tools daily. Not as a crutch, but as a force multiplier. If you're not already using AI in your development workflow, this isn't the right fit\n\r\nDocumentation habits you write code comments, maintain READMEs, and document architecture decisions. We never want to be in a position where only you understand how something is built\n\r\nIndependence you can take a brief, ask smart questions, and deliver without constant oversight\n\r\nAttention to detail pixel level precision on implementation. If the design says 24px padding, it's 24px padding\n\r\n\n\r\nNice-to-Haves\n\r\n\n\r\nFramer experience\n\r\nGSAP / animation libraries\n\r\nGA4 and Google Tag Manager setup experience\n\r\nKlaviyo or similar\n platform experience\n\r\nPerformance optimisation (Core Web Vitals, caching, CDN)\n\r\nAPI integration experience (REST APIs, webhooks)\n\r\nCI/CD and deployment pipeline experience\n\r\nExperience with headless CMS setups\n\r\nUnderstanding of SEO best practices\n\r\nAgile thinking you understand iterative development, not just waterfall task execution\n\r\nCoaching tea\nmbers\n\r\n\n\r\nHow You'll Work\n\r\n\n\r\nEmbedded in the team — you'll be on Slack, standups and all tea\netings\n\r\nTimezone overlap with Sydney - you work from 11am Sydney time year round\n\r\nDirect communication - you'll work directly with the founder and Art Director, not through a project manager or ticketing black box\n\r\nStructured engineering practices — we're building proper Git workflows, PR processes, and code review practices together. You'll have input into how we set these up\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Standards\n\r\nWe're moving away from an external agency because their output consistently didn't meet our standards. To be direct about what that means:\n\r\n\n\r\nA page duplication with copy and image swaps should take 2–3 hours, not 20\n\r\nA loading animation should actually loop until the page is ready, not play once and show a black screen\n\r\nIf you're building ACF sections, they should be modular enough to reuse across pages without rebuilding from scratch every time\n\r\nCode should be clean, commented, documented, and structured — not 150 lines of inline CSS with no explanation\n\r\nIf something will take longer than expected, we want to know upfront with a clear explanation — not a post-hoc justification\n\r\nEvery project should have a README. Every architectural decision should be documented. We will never again be in a position where only one person or team understands how something works\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're not unreasonable. We understand complexity. But we don't accept padded hours or sloppy architecture.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Growth\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting: Part-time (30 hours/week)\n\r\nGrowth path: Full-time as revenue scales, with compensation growth to match\n\r\nLong-term: For the right person, this evolves into a technical lead role with broader architectural responsibility and compensation that reflects it\n\r\nPayment: Monthly, USD\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nDon't send a generic cover letter. Instead, send us:\n\r\nYour portfolio \n\r\nLoom video introduction\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation\n\r\nPhilippines based candidates only.                ",

We use technology heavily to automate our operations and are looking for a smart, motivated developer to help us build and expand our automation systems.\n\r\n\n\r\n## The Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need a sharp, resourceful junior developer who is comfortable using AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude Code) to build real, working solutions. **You don't need to be a senior engineer.** You need to be intelligent, honest, and relentless about figuring things out.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be integrating multiple business platforms via their APIs into a centralized data system, building automation workflows, and growing into more advanced AI projects over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n**This is NOT a role for someone who wants to bill hours and drag projects out.** We want someone who takes ownership, moves fast, delivers results, and charges fairly.\n\r\n\n\r\n## What You'll Do\n\r\n\n\r\n- Connect APIs (Gmail, Hostaway, OpenPhone, (Quo) \n) into a centralized data system (MCP architecture)\n\r\n- Use Claude, Claude Code, and other AI tools as your daily co-pilot to write, debug, and ship code\n\r\n- Build simple but functional automation pipelines that process data across platforms\n\r\n- Communicate progress clearly, ask good questions when stuck, and document your work\n\r\n- Grow into more advanced projects: voice AI (ElevenLabs), video AI (HeyGen), guest-facing interfaces\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n**Must-Have:**\n\r\n- High problem-solving ability — you figure things out, you don't give up easily\n\r\n- Basic comfort with Python or JavaScript (you don't need to be an expert)\n\r\n- Already using AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) to code and learn faster\n\r\n- Honest, reliable, responsive communication (we use async communication heavily)\n\r\n- You'd rather ship something that works than overthink it\n\r\n- Strong English communication skills (written)\n\r\n- Available 20-40 hours per week with consistent schedule\n\r\n\n\r\n**Nice-to-Have:**\n\r\n- Familiarity with REST APIs and webhooks\n\r\n- Experience with \n, n8n, or Zapier\n\r\n- Familiarity with Git/GitHub\n\r\n\n\r\n**What Does NOT Matter:**\n\r\n- Years of experience\n\r\n- Computer Science degree\n\r\n- Having used these specific APIs before\n\r\n- Your age (we care about ability, not credentials)\n\r\n\n\r\n## What We Offer\n\r\n\n\r\n- a posibility of  long-term part-time work with a fair employer\n\r\n- Access to Claude Pro and AI development tools (we pay for your tools)\n\r\n- Real projects that ship — not busywork\n\r\n- Opportunity to grow your skills on interesting AI/automation projects\n\r\n- Direct communication with the founder (no corporate bureaucracy)\n\r\n\n\r\n## Minimum Requirements to Apply\n\r\n\n\r\n**You MUST meet ALL of the following to be considered. Applications missing any of these will be ignored.**\n\r\n\n\r\n### 1. Proof of a Working Project\n\r\n\n\r\nYou must share a link to at least ONE project you have built that involves code. This can be:\n\r\n- A GitHub, GitLab, or Replit link\n\r\n- A CodePen or CodeSandbox link\n\r\n- A deployed app or website you built\n\r\n- A Google Drive link to a project folder with source code\n\r\n\n\r\nThe project does NOT need to be complex. It could be a simple automation script, a web scraper, a basic web app, a bot, a data tool — anything. But it must be real code that you wrote (with or without AI assistance), and you must be able to explain it.\n\r\n\n\r\n**No link = no consideration. No exceptions.** \n\r\n\n\r\n### 2. Demonstrate AI Tool Usage\n\r\n\n\r\nRecord a short Loom video (2-3 minutes max) showing:\n\r\n\n\r\n- You opening Claude.ai (free version is fine) or ChatGPT\n\r\n- You giving it a coding prompt related to an API integration (any API)\n\r\n- You explaining what the AI gave you, what's correct, and what you would fix or improve\n\r\n\n\r\nThis shows me you actually use AI tools and understand what the code does — not just copy-paste blindly.\n\r\n\n\r\n**No Loom video = no consideration.**\n\r\n\n\r\n### 3. Written Application Answers\n\r\n\n\r\nAnswer ALL of these questions in your application:\n\r\n\n\r\n**A)** What programming language(s) are you most comfortable with? Rate yourself 1-10 for each and be honest — I respect honesty more than inflated numbers.\n\r\n\n\r\n**B)** Have you ever connected to a REST API? If yes, which one(s) and what did you do with the data? If no, that's okay — describe how you would approach it for the first time.\n\r\n\n\r\n**C)** What is your hourly rate expectation in USD? How many hours per week are you available, and what hours/time zone do you work in?\n\r\n\n\r\n**D)** Why do you want this role specifically? (2-3 sentences — I can spot copy-paste answers.)\n\r\n\n\r\n---\n\r\n\n\r\nYour application must include,\n\r\n\n\r\nLink to at least one code project you built\n\r\nLoom video showing you using an AI coding tool (2-3 min)\n\r\nWritten answers to questions A, B, C, and D above\n\r\n\n\r\n**Incomplete applications will not be reviewed.** I know this is a lot to ask — that's intentional. If you take the time to do this, you're already ahead of 90% of applicants.                ",

If you love building \nntum, spotting angles, cutting sharp videos, reacting fast, and watching content explode, keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur platform has been dubbed the Uber of Real Estate. We’re launching aggressively and we expect attention, criticism & scale, and we’re building a serious media operation to match that ambition.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll actually be doing day to day\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will run our social presence, and that means:\n\r\n• planning content\n\r\n• creating content\n\r\n• editing content\n\r\n• posting content\n\r\n• reacting to what happens because of the content\n\r\n• and doing it again, faster, smarter, better\n\r\n\n\r\nPlatforms Managed\n\r\n• Instagram (posts, reels, stories)\n\r\n•\n (page, groups)\n\r\n• TikTok (videos, trends, skits)\n\r\n• YouTube (shorts, testimonials, explainer videos)\n\r\n• LinkedIn (company, founder profile)\n\r\n• Threads\n\r\n•\n/X (brand, PR, viral threads)\n\r\n• Google Business Profile (for reviews and posts)\n\r\n\n\r\nSome days you’ll be editing planned content, other days you’ll be cutting a clip or post within hours because something unexpected blew up. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis role rewards people who think like editors and producers, not just schedulers.\n\r\n\n\r\nSome content is planned a month ahead, some content is created because something just happened. You need to be good at both.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat we’re looking for:\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re looking for someone who already knows what they’re doing.\n\r\nYou should have 5+ years of experience managing brand social media, not personal pages and not hobby accounts.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou should:\n\r\n\n\r\n• personally edit short-form video (this is non-negotiable)\n\r\n• understand hooks, pacing, subtitles, and retention\n\r\n• have taste and restraint, not just trend addiction\n\r\n• be comfortable producing 15–20 pieces of content per week\n\r\n• stay calm when comments turn negative or heated\n\r\n• enjoy fast-moving environments\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not a role where someone tells you exactly what to post every day. You’re expected to have initiative & think.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat success looks like\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter a few months, our accounts should feel like: “These guys are everywhere.”\n\r\nContent should:\n\r\n• spark discussion\n\r\n• trigger reactions\n\r\n• get shared into group chats\n\r\n• be stitched, duetted, screenshotted\n\r\n• shape how people talk about the industry\n\r\n\n\r\nIf something hits, you know how to milk it.\n\r\nIf something doesn’t, you know how to kill it.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy this role is exciting\n\r\nYou’re joining before the big spotlight.\n\r\nYou’ll help define:\n\r\n• how the brand sounds\n\r\n• how it moves\n\r\n• how fast it reacts\n\r\n• what it becomes known for\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn’t a short campaign or a throwaway contract.\n\r\nIf you’re good, you’ll grow with the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll apply via our Google Form where we’ll ask for:\n\r\n• proof of experience\n\r\n• examples of your video editing\n\r\n• how you think about content\n\r\n\n\r\n???? \n\r\n\n\r\nFinal note\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re building something loud, visible, and serious.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want safe, predictable work, skip this.\n\r\nIf you want to build a media engine and be proud of it, we want to hear from you.

This role combines guest relations, reservation management, and administrative tasks to ensure seamless service and operational accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\r\n- This is NOT a generic support role.\n\r\n- You’ll be juggling guests, cleaners, and maintenance teams in real time — often with imperfect information and real consequences if poor decisions are made. Because of that, our hiring process is intentionally more challenging than a typical “message responder” position.\n\r\n- The assessment you’re about to take is designed to understand how you think — how you prioritize, communicate, and make judgment calls when there isn’t one obvious right answer.\n\r\n- If you enjoy solving realistic scenarios, thinking critically, and taking ownership, you will likely enjoy both this assessment and the job itself. If you are looking for a simple, scripted support role, this probably won’t be the right fit — and that’s okay.\n\r\n\n\r\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\r\nGuest Communications & Support\n\r\n- Respond promptly and professionally to booking inquiries, guest messages, and support requests across multiple platforms.\n\r\n- Provide phone support to address urgent guest needs and ensure timely issue resolution.\n\r\n- Collaborate with the operations team to facilitate smooth check-ins, check-outs, and overall guest satisfaction.\n\r\n\n\r\nOperational & Administrative Support\n\r\n- Perform booking cleanup, ensuring reservations are accurate and conflicts are resolved.\n\r\n- Conduct guest cleanup by maintaining accurate records and organizing guest profiles.\n\r\n- Manage listing accuracy and resolve platform-related issues across Airbnb, \n, Expedia, etc.\n\r\n- Support accounting functions, including expense tracking, invoice updates, and discrepancy reporting.\n\r\n- Assist in lead management, including organizing, qualifying, and supporting follow-up efforts for potential property acquisition opportunities.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n- Experience with short-term rental platforms (Airbnb, \n, Vrbo, etc.).\n\r\n- Strong communication skills and professional phone etiquette.\n\r\n- Detail-oriented with strong organizational abilities.\n\r\n-Tech-savvy and able to work independently during overnight shifts.\n\r\n- PREFERRED: Experience with PriceLabs, Beds24, accounting tasks, or lead management.\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY\n\r\nUpload your resume here >>> \n/s/5sal0p7n                ",

We are a premier marketing agency serving the U.S. Collision Repair (Body Shop) industry. We help shop owners tough, busy entrepreneurs, get more crashed cars into their shops.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur owner, Shah, is the only salesperson. We have a high-tech system in place where leads from various avenues are automatically prompted to schedule an appointment. Your job is the human safety net. If a lead does not book, if they cancel, or if they \"think about it,\" you are the one who hunts them down. You will follow up until they sign, they tell you to stop, or they are dead.\n\r\n\n\r\n0% LEAD LEAKAGE IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE METRIC.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Brutal Truth (Read This Carefully)\n\r\nThis is a high-pressure, high-volume role.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe English Requirement: You must speak English with zero accent. Your cadence, slang, and tone must be indistinguishable from a native North American speaker. You will be calling blue-collar business owners in the U.S.; you must sound friendly, professional, and natural. If you have a \"call center\" accent, do not apply.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Intensity: You will be on the phone and in GoHighLevel all day.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Responsibility: You are the gatekeeper of Shah’s calendar. If his calendar has a gap, you are losing the company money.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour 5 Orders of Priority\n\r\nThe Calendar Guardian: You call and confirm every single lead on Shah’s schedule for today, tomorrow, and the day after. If they don't confirm by phone, they don't get the meeting.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Gap Filler (The Hunter): If a lead is booked for next Tuesday, but Shah has a gap today at 2:00 PM, you call that lead and convince them to move their appointment up to today.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Resurrector: You track every \"No-Show.\" You call them within 5 minutes of their missed meeting to get them back on the books.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Persistence Specialist: You follow up with every lead that \"slipped through the cracks.\" If the automation didn't get them to book, you do it manually. You manage the \"Long-Game\" leads who saw a demo but haven't signed yet.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Newsletter Architect: You will draft weekly persuasive newsletters using our \"Proof of Success\" (e.g., how we generated $45k in revenue for a shop in 3 months) to nurture our database into booking calls.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical Requirements\n\r\nGoHighLevel (GHL) Mastery: You must be proficient in GHL pipelines and CRM management.\n\r\n\n\r\nSystem Builder: You must be able to create your own SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) so that your follow-up process is repeatable and flawless.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Safety Net\" Mindset: You take it personally when a lead is \"lost.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nTHE GAUNTLET: How To Apply\n\r\nFailure to follow these instructions exactly results in an immediate \"Deleted\" status.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1: Your Subject Line Must read: \"I am the Lead Superhero Shah is looking for - [Your Full Name]\"\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2: Tell me what my name\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 3: Written Questions (Answer in your application)\n\r\n\n\r\nDescribe a time you built a manual follow-up system that increased conversion.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat is your philosophy on \"Lead Leakage\"?\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you were an animal, what would you be and why? (Be creative).\n\r\n\n\r\nBriefly explain how a DRP (Direct Repair Program) works in a U.S. Body Shop.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat is a \"supplement\" in collision repair and why does it matter to a shop owner?\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 4: THE VIDEO (Mandatory Final Filter) Provide a link to a Loom or direct video (5 minutes maximum). IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS YOUR APPLICATION WILL IMMEDIATELY BW REJECTED.\n\r\n\n\r\nSection A (Intro): Introduce yourself and describe your experience with cars or the automotive industry.\n\r\n\n\r\nSection B (The Quiz): Answer these on camera without reading a script:\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat is the difference between a fender and a bumper?\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do insurance deductibles work?\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat does it mean for a customer to \"pay out of pocket\" vs. \"go through insurance\"?\n\r\n\n\r\nSection C (The Roleplay): Shah has an open slot at 2:00 PM today. A lead named \"John\" is scheduled for next Friday. Call John and use your natural, friendly, persuasive English to move him to the 2:00 PM slot today. We are judging your accent, your confidence, and your \"vibe.\"                ",

You will utilize Laravel Jobs and Redis to handle triggers, notifications, and complex data processing in the background.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Ensure System Reliability: Monitor and optimize application health using Laravel Horizon for queue management and Sentry for error tracking. You’ll be responsible for debugging failed jobs and maintaining a clean error log.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Maintain Data Integrity: Implement audit logging (e.g., Laravel Auditing) to track critical user actions and data changes for security and debugging.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Write Clean, Type-Safe Code: Maintain high standards with strict TypeScript on the frontend and solid object-oriented design patterns on the backend.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\n- Laravel Mastery: You are comfortable with Eloquent, Service Classes, Policies, and sophisticated database migrations.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Modern Frontend Skills: You know React beyond the basics. You understand hooks, state management, and how to create reusable UI components with Tailwind CSS.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Inertia.js Experience: You understand how Inertia acts as the glue between the server and client, avoiding the complexity of full REST/GraphQL APIs where they aren't needed.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Production Experience with Queues: You have set up and managed Redis/Horizon in a production environment. You understand how to handle failed jobs, retries, and batching.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Debugging & Auditing: You don't just fix bugs; you implement systems to catch them. You are familiar with error tracking flows and keeping audit trails for critical business logic.                ",
