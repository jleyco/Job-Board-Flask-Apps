This role requires efficiency and speed, as the editor will be responsible for producing 12 videos per day with same-day delivery.\n\r\n\n\r\nStrong English listening comprehension is required.

This includes using jump cuts, zooms, basic motion, sound effects when appropriate, and adding product images or assets that are provided. No captions or subtitles are required for these edits.\n\r\n\n\r\nSpeed, reliability, and consistency are critical. The current workload of 12 videos typically takes approximately 2–3 hours per day, so the editor must be able to work efficiently while maintaining quality and meeting same-day deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nTechnical proficiency with CapCut, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or similar video editing software is required. The editor should also be comfortable exporting videos in TikTok-ready vertical formats and performing basic audio cleanup and leveling when needed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role requires someone who can work independently, make good judgment calls, accept feedback, and implement revisions quickly. This is not a beginner position and is intended as a long-term, full-time role for the right candidate.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you apply please include 2 or 3 examples of your previous work.                ",

The work needs to be completed each morning once Xero has updated overnight. As long as the work is done and I can see results, the exact timing within the morning window is flexible.\n\r\n•Service window: 8:00am - 10:00am AEST (approximate)\n\r\n•Flexibility within that window based on workload\n\r\n•What matters: work is complete, accurate, and I can see the results\n\r\n•No micromanagement of hours if outcomes are delivered\n\r\n\n\r\nPrimary Values\n\r\n\n\r\nHighest Standards : Every figure is correct. Every reconciliation balances. Every statement is accurate. No sloppy work, no assumptions, no 'it's probably right'.\n\r\n\n\r\nOwnership: You own the numbers. If something doesn't balance, you find out why. If a payment is missing, you chase it. You don't wait to be told there's a problem.\n\r\n\n\r\nDeliver Results:  The work gets done every morning. Reports are ready when needed. Queries are resolved, not parked.

Ensure accuracy of amounts, services, and client details. Chase overdue payments.\n\r\n2 Accounts Payable Process supplier invoices, verify against purchase orders or approvals, schedule payments, and maintain accurate creditor records.\n\r\n3 Debt Collection Actively chase outstanding debts. Request and follow up on statements. Resolve queries promptly. Escalate aged debt as per agreed thresholds.\n\r\n4 Bank Reconciliation Reconcile all bank accounts daily once Xero updates. Identify and resolve discrepancies. No unmatched transactions left unaddressed.\n\r\n5 Multi-Entity Management Manage accounts across Australian and UAE entities. Maintain clean separation between entities. Ensure intercompany transactions are properly recorded.\n\r\n6 Statement Requests Request statements from suppliers and debtors as needed. Confirm balances. Identify and resolve any discrepancies between records.\n\r\n7 Query Resolution Respond to and resolve queries from clients, suppliers, and internal stakeholders. Don't let queries sit. Own them until resolved.\n\r\n8 Financial Statements Prepare monthly Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet for each entity. Ensure statements are accurate, complete, and delivered by agreed deadlines.\n\r\n9 Month-End Close Complete month-end close procedures. Ensure all transactions are posted, accruals are recorded, and accounts are ready for reporting.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements\n\r\nEssential\n\r\n•Strong Xero experience (this is non-negotiable)\n\r\n•Experience managing accounts for multiple entities\n\r\n•Ability to prepare financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet)\n\r\n•Experience with accounts receivable, accounts payable, and bank reconciliation\n\r\n•Comfortable chasing payments and resolving queries professionally\n\r\n•Reliable internet and quiet workspace\n\r\n•Available within the 8:00am - 10:00am AEST service window\n\r\nDesirable\n\r\n•Accounting qualification (CPA, CA, or equivalent)\n\r\n•Experience with Australian accounting standards (UAE experience a plus)\n\r\n•Experience in a services or professional services business\n\r\nWhat Success Looks Like\n\r\n•Bank accounts reconciled daily, no unexplained items\n\r\n•Invoices sent on time and accurately\n\r\n•Debts chased proactively, not aged silently\n\r\n•Queries resolved, not parked\n\r\n•Financial statements ready when needed, accurate and complete\n\r\n•I can see results each morning without having to ask\n\r\n•Problems flagged early, not discovered later\n\r\nThe Non-Negotiables\n\r\n•Accuracy is everything. If you're not sure, check. If you can't check, ask.\n\r\n•Don't let things age silently. If a debt is overdue, chase it. If a query is unresolved, resolve it.\n\r\n•Own your numbers. If something doesn't balance, it's your job to find out why.\n\r\n•Communicate proactively. If there's a problem, I should hear it from you first.\n\r\n•Results matter more than hours.

    "description": "\n                    Company Background:\n\r\nA quickly growing real estate investment company is seeking a new tea\nmber to help guide families through the process of purchasing their forever home. We pride ourselves on helping them by solving a problem they didn’t think there was a solution for.  We have had people cry because they were so thankful that we purchased their house or sold them a home.  We also help people buy a home that wouldn’t qualify for a traditional bank loan.  It is an excellent and exciting feeling!\n\r\n\n\r\nOur positions do not require prior real estate experience because we will slowly teach the industry.  We have a hard-working yet fun and energetic team that is mainly remote-based.  We spend time on professional and personal development for all employees and end the week with Dad Joke Fridays.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is an excellent opportunity to learn more about the real estate industry and the non-retail method of buying and selling properties.  You will work closely with the business owner and take on more responsibilities over time.  We are only looking for a full-time role but are flexible with our work schedule as we don’t track sick or time off days, you are a professional and would be treated that way.  \n\r\n\n\r\nJob Description:\n\r\nAs our Insurance Verification Specialist, you will use your strong communication skills with buyers and tenants to refine their insurance needs.  After the disposition team sells a property, you will manage the intricate details with the homeowner/tenant, mortgage company, and insurance provider.  This role requires attention to detail and good problem-solving skills as you will be helping people through one of the most stressful activities of their lives: buying their family home.\n\r\n\n\r\nWith your strong analytical skills, you will review and verify policies, ensuring accuracy and compliance throughout transactions, and be the single point of contact for both the buyer/tenant and the loan servicing company. You will be responsible for maintaining an up-to-date record of tasks in Salesforce, our CRM.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who is detail-oriented and dedicated and possesses excellent organizational skills. The more experience you have in real estate, the better, but it is not required for this role.  We will conduct on-the-job training as you grow into the role over time.  \n\r\n\n\r\nMessages from current tea\nmbers: Here is a collection of short videos from existing tea\nmbers on their thoughts on working with us.  We pride ourselves on our culture and would love to add you to our team:  \n \n\r\n\n\r\nResponsibilities and Duties:\n\r\n* Enter insurance details into Salesforce\n\r\n* Communicate with Insurance companies to update records and manage claims\n\r\n* Provide borrowers with a list of insurance agents and assist in obtaining coverage\n\r\n* Manage insurance renewals by communicating with borrowers and renters\n\r\n* Serve as a liaison between all parties involved, establishing effective communication channels until closing.\n\r\n* Maintain an updated record of all completed tasks in the Salesforce CRM\n\r\n* Organize and maintain document filing in our database.\n\r\n* Update the seller's insurance contact details for our records.\n\r\n* Obtain insurance quotes from agents for newly contracted properties.\n\r\n* Cancel the seller's insurance policy after closing and ensure the refund is sent to our designated mailing address\n\r\n* Secure new insurance policies for newly purchased properties.\n\r\n* Build training guides to outline all processes you complete regularly\n\r\n* Perform a variety of other miscellaneous tasks\n\r\n\n\r\nPerks:\n\r\n* $5.40/hr ($11,232/year)\n\r\n* $50.00 Bonus when we sell a property (estimated $1,750/year)\n\r\n* .5% Commission on insurance claims paid out (estimated $1,125/year)\n\r\n* Health Insurance \n\r\n* Flexible work schedule\n\r\n* 13th month pay\n\r\n* We want to make sure you are well compensated for your work efforts and are only looking for full-time employees.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n* Bachelor’s Degree\n\r\n* VA experience for at least 2 years\n\r\n* Attention to detail across all projects\n\r\n* Fluent in English - written and verbal\n\r\n* Proficient with Google Drive/Docs/Sheets, Salesforce, Dropbox, and Slack\n\r\n* Familiar with Mac; if you don't have one, we can help you get one if so desired \n\r\n* Consistent, reliable, and fast internet connection\n\r\n  \n\r\n---------------\n\r\nWhy should you join us over anyone and everyone else? \n\r\n1) Steady paycheck with the chance for bonuses based on performance \n\r\n2) Opportunity to work from home without a boss breathing down your neck \n\r\n3) Team environment where you work with others to share the workload\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do you know if you’re qualified for this opportunity? \n\r\nWe don’t care if you have prior experience in the real estate field.  We can teach you everything you need to know about our clients and our field so you can excel at your job.  We can teach anyone with a good attitude who is self-motivated for more.  These are things you must demonstrate in the interview process. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe working hours? \n\r\nAs I stated before, our company is based in Texas, so we require you to work during US business hours, preferably 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM CST (with an hour off for lunch) or 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM CST.  There is some flexibility here, but you would interact with us during business hours and follow up with U.S. companies and families living in the Central Standard Time zone.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about pay?\n\r\nWe are serious about hiring someone and are looking to fill this position ASAP.  I also want this to be a real job that can meet your financial needs.  We pay your 13th month pay, bonuses, annual pay increases, etc. \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about the 13th Month? \n\r\nDo we pay the 13th month?  Of course, we do.  It’s part of Filipino culture, and we want to be a part of it too. We pay half of the 13th month in the 3rd quarter for school supplies, etc., for your kids (or whatever else you choose) and the other half right before Christmas. \n\r\n\n\r\nWhat happens next? \n\r\nSince our jobs are so popular, we generally get deluged with applicants.  So, I have designed a multi-part interview process to make the process simple and efficient for all parties.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThe first part of the interview process is designed to examine your English-speaking & writing skills, personality type, internet speed, and ability to follow directions. Please be advised that those who submit incomplete applications will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you make it through this first round, we will talk via video chat to answer any questions and get to know you better. \n\r\n\n\r\nWe will then ultimately hire someone, potentially you!!!\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply: \n\r\nTo submit your application for the job, please complete all of the following and\n them to us at \n Please complete this quick assessment, as it will be our primary initial qualification: \n\r\n* Video yourself looking at the camera and explain why you would be a good fit for this position.

You will work closely with me to execute high-level marketing strategies.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are not looking for a resume filled with corporate years. We are looking for raw potential, high intelligence, and practical AI skills.

You have experience with Prompt Engineering and understand how to structure complex prompts for tools like Gemini, ChatGPT, or Midjourney to get the exact result you want.\n\r\nHigh Intelligence: You figure things out. You are a problem solver who doesn’t need your hand held for every small task.\n\r\nImpeccable English: You must have a strong grasp of the English language, both verbal and written, as you will be crafting detailed prompts and communicating with the team daily.\n\r\nTech-Reliable: You have a fast internet connection and a proven backup plan for power outages or internet issues. You must work from a reliable laptop or desktop computer (No phones/tablets).\n\r\nCoachable: Since we will be working closely together, you must be eager to receive direct feedback and improve immediately.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompensation & Perks\n\r\nCompetitive Pay: $700 - $800 USD/month starting salary.\n\r\nBonus Potential: After a few months of proven performance, you will be eligible for a performance-based bonus structure.\n\r\nMentorship: You will be directly mentored by the Marketing Manager, with exposure to the CEO.\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply (Read Carefully)\n\r\nTo ensure we hire someone with great communication skills and attention to detail, applications without a video will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1: Record a short video (2-3 minutes max) Please show your face and answer the following three questions specifically:\n\r\n1. If an AI tool isn't giving you the result you want after 5 tries, what is your specific process for troubleshooting the prompt? Walk me through how you adjust your language or parameters.\n\r\n2. Describe a specific time you encountered a technical problem (with software or a computer) that you had no idea how to fix. Walk me through the exact steps you took to find the solution before asking for help.\n\r\n3. Pick a complex concept (it can be anything—crypto, cooking, a video game mechanic) and explain it to me in 30 seconds as if I know nothing about it.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2: Submit your Application \n\r\n the Link to your Resume and your video to: \n \n\r\nSubject Line: Marketing Assistant Application - [Your Name]\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: We may hire two candidates on a 30-day paid trial basis to determine the best long-term fit.
