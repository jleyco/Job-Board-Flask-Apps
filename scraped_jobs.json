Our clients aren't just property owners—they're building generational wealth, and they depend on us to give them the clarity they need to make smart decisions.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're a small, tight-knit remote team (currently just two of us!) that values accuracy over speed, proactive communication, and continuous learning. We don't micromanage—we hire self-directed professionals who take ownership of their work and treat our clients' businesses like their own.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're at an exciting inflection point: we have more clients than we can handle (great problem!), and we need a second VA to help us scale without sacrificing the quality our clients love.\n\r\n\n\r\nQuick note: When you\n your application, please start your message with \"I'm excited to apply for the bookkeeping position at Real Cents Organized\" so we know your\n didn't get caught in our spam filter. We've had issues with legitimate applications landing in junk folders lately!\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\n\n\r\nWe need a detail-obsessed bookkeeping VA who lives and breathes QuickBooks Online, understands the unique challenges of real estate accounting, and can work independently to deliver accurate financials on tight deadlines.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't data entry—this is strategic bookkeeping. You'll be the person who catches the $5,000 repair that should have been capitalized before it costs our client their tax deduction. You'll be the one who spots a missing security deposit refund before the landlord gets a call from an angry tenant.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're the type of person who color-codes their personal budget, triple-checks your work, and feels genuine satisfaction when a reconciliation balances to the penny—keep reading.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Description\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll be responsible for these specific deliverables each month:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Transaction Categorization: Accurately categorize monthly transactions across multiple rental properties in QuickBooks Online. You'll distinguish between repairs vs. capital improvements, allocate expenses to the correct properties, and ensure every transaction supports defensible tax positions.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Bank Reconciliations: Reconcile bank accounts monthly with 100?curacy. Find every discrepancy—even the $0.23 rounding errors—because precision matters.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Property-Level Financial Reporting: Generate clean, client-ready profit & loss statements for each rental property, plus consolidated owner statements, by the 5th of each month. No excuses, no delays—landlords make decisions based on these reports.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Compliance Tracking: Maintain meticulous records for security deposits, track vendor payments for 1099 preparation, and flag any transactions that could trigger IRS scrutiny.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Proactive Communication: Use ClickUp to update task status daily, flag discrepancies before they become problems, and ask clarifying questions when something doesn't add up. We'd rather you ask 10 \"unnecessary\" questions than make 1 incorrect assumption.\n\r\n\n\r\nQualifications\n\r\n\n\r\nWe care more about **how you think** than where you went to school. Here's what matters:\n\r\n\n\r\n- QuickBooks Online fluency - You don't just know where the buttons are; you understand chart of accounts structure, class/location tracking, and can troubleshoot when things break.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Real estate accounting experience - You've worked with rental properties before and understand the difference between a repair (expense immediately) and an improvement (capitalize and depreciate). Bonus if you've handled short-term rentals.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Obsessive attention to detail - You're the person who notices when a transaction is coded to \"Property A - Unit 1\" when it should be \"Property A - Unit 2.\" Small mistakes compound into big problems in this work.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Strong written English - You'll communicate directly with ClickUp comments and occasional\ns. We need clear, professional communication that builds trust.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Self-directed work style - We're async and remote. You won't have someone looking over your shoulder. You need to manage your own time, prioritize ruthlessly, and deliver on deadlines without hand-holding.\n\r\n\n\r\n- Technology comfort - Beyond QBO, you'll use ClickUp (project management and communication), Google Workspace, and ScreenshotMonitor (screen recordings).\n\r\n\n\r\nSalary & Growth\n\r\n\n\r\nStarting Compensation: $7/hour for 20-30 hours per week ($560-$840/month)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe know this is competitive for the Philippines market, and we're willing to pay for quality. After your 60-day trial period, here's the path forward:\n\r\n\n\r\n- **Month 6+:** Increase to $8/hour + potential for full-time hours (40/week = $1,280/month)\n\r\n- **Year 2:** Promotion to Senior Bookkeeper at $10/hour managing your own portfolio of clients\n\r\n- **Year 3+:** Potential equity stake or profit-sharing as we scale (we want to build this together)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don't just hire people—we invest in them. Our current VA has been with us for 18 months.  \n\r\n\n\r\nPersonality Profile\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're probably a great fit if:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- You get genuine satisfaction from balancing to the penny (and mild anxiety when things are off by $0.01)\n\r\n- You're naturally skeptical—when something looks weird, you dig deeper instead of ignoring it\n\r\n- You prefer written communication over phone calls (but can handle a video call when needed)\n\r\n- You have a system for everything (folders, naming conventions, checklists—you're organized AF)\n\r\n- You'd describe yourself as reliable, methodical, and low-drama\n\r\n- You like working independently but aren't afraid to ask for help when you need it\n\r\n\n\r\n**You're probably NOT a great fit if:**\n\r\n\n\r\n- You're easily bored by repetitive tasks (bookkeeping has a rhythm—embrace it)\n\r\n- You're a \"big picture\" thinker who hates details (we need detail ninjas)\n\r\n- You need constant feedback and validation to stay motivated\n\r\n- You struggle with deadlines or tend to procrastinate\n\r\n- You're juggling 5 other clients and can only give us 5 hours/week of distracted attention\n\r\n\n\r\nSkunks (Deal-Breakers)\n\r\n\n\r\nLet's be honest about potential challenges upfront. These are non-negotiable, so please only apply if you're genuinely comfortable with:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Strict Deadlines: Month-end close is sacred. If reports are due by the 5th, \"the 6th\" isn't acceptable. Clients make financial decisions based on our timelines.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. High Accountability: Every error has real consequences. A misclassified transaction could cost a client thousands in unnecessary taxes or trigger an IRS audit. We need someone who takes this seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Occasional US Business Hours: Most work is async, but you may need to join tea\netings during US Eastern Time business hours (which means early morning if you're in the Philippines). This won't be daily, but maybe 2-4 times per month.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. 60-Day Trial Period: We're investing heavily in finding the right person (hence this detailed job posting!). The first 60 days are a mutual evaluation. If it's not working for either of us, we'll part ways professionally—no hard feelings.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Real Estate Focus: If you're looking to do general bookkeeping across industries, this isn't the role. We specialize in rental properties, and you'll need to develop deep expertise in this niche.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Values\n\r\n\n\r\nThese aren't just words on a wall—we actually make decisions based on these:\n\r\n\n\r\n1. Accuracy Over Speed\n\r\nWe'd rather you take an extra hour to get it right than rush and create cleanup work. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Proactive Communication\n\r\nDon't wait for us to ask. If you see a problem, flag it. If you're unsure, ask. If you'll miss a deadline, tell us ASAP so we can plan.\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Continuous Learning\n\r\nTax laws change. QBO adds features. Real estate strategies evolve. We expect you to stay current through webinars, articles, and training (which we'll provide/fund).\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Client-First Mindset\n\r\nOur clients are building generational wealth for their families. Treat their money with the same respect you'd want someone to treat yours.\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Trust & Ownership\n\r\nWe don't micromanage. We hire adults, give them the tools and context they need, and trust them to deliver. In exchange, you own your results—good and bad.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo Apply\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's what we need from you (this is a test—follow the instructions exactly):\n\r\n\n\r\n1.\n Subject Line\n\r\n\"I actually read the instructions\"\n\r\n\n\r\nIf your subject line is anything else (like \"Bookkeeping VA Application\"), we'll know you didn't read this carefully—and attention to detail is literally the job.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Resume\n\r\n- File name: `FirstName_LastName_BookkeepingVA.pdf`\n\r\n- Example: `Maria_Santos_BookkeepingVA.pdf`\n\r\n- Highlight your QuickBooks Online experience and any real estate/property management clients\n\r\n- Keep it to 1-2 pages max—we value clarity over length\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Personality Assessment\n\r\nTake the free 16Personalities test at \n and include your 4-letter result (e.g., ISTJ, ISFJ) in your\n. We use this to understand work style, not to exclude anyone—there's no \"right\" answer.\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Creative Question\n\r\nAnswer this in 2-3 sentences within your\n:\n\r\n\n\r\n\"If you were a QuickBooks report, which one would you be and why?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n(Seriously. We want to see how you think about the work, not just your resume credentials.)\n\r\n\n\r\n5. Video Introduction\n\r\nRecord a 60-second Loom video (\n is free) covering:\n\r\n- Your name and where you're based\n\r\n- Your QuickBooks Online experience (how many years? what industries?)\n\r\n- One example of a costly error you caught before it became a problem\n\r\n- Why you're interested in specializing in real estate bookkeeping\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude the Loom link in your\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n6. Sample Work (Optional, but Impressive)\n\r\nIf you have any property-level P&Ls, reconciliation screenshots, or examples of your QBO work (with client names redacted), include them. Show us what \"excellent\" looks like in your book.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat Happens Next?\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's our hiring process (transparent, fast, and designed to avoid wasting your time):\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 1: We'll review applications and respond within 3 business days. If your application follows instructions and looks strong, we'll invite you to a paid trial project.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 2: Trial project ($20 for ~2 hours of work). We'll give you access to a QuickBooks sandbox with realistic scenarios. This lets you see the actual work, and lets us evaluate your skills beyond a resume.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 3: Top 2-3 candidates from the trial project will have a 30-45 minute Zoom interview. We'll discuss the work, your trial project, and cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nWeek 4: We'll make an offer, finalize the contractor agreement, and get you onboarded!\n\r\n\n\r\nTotal timeline from application to start date: 3-4 weeks max.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy You Should Apply (Even If You're Nervous)\n\r\n\n\r\nLook, we know imposter syndrome is real. You might be reading this thinking, \"I don't check every single box—should I even apply?\"\n\r\n\n\r\nHere's our take: If you're detail-oriented, have solid QBO skills, and are willing to learn real estate accounting specifics, we want to hear from you. We'd rather teach someone the technical stuff (we can train) than try to teach attention to detail or work ethic (you either have that or you don't).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe fact that you read this entire job posting (it's long—congrats if you made it here!) suggests you're thorough. That's exactly what we need.\n\r\n\n\r\nReady to Apply?\n\r\n\n\r\nSend your application to: \n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: \"I actually read the instructions\"\n\r\n\n\r\nInclude:\n\r\n1. Resume (FirstName_LastName_BookkeepingVA.pdf)\n\r\n2. Personality type (from \n)\n\r\n3. Answer to the QuickBooks report question\n\r\n4. Loom video link (60 seconds)\n\r\n5. Optional: Sample work\n\r\n\n\r\nApplication deadline: March 12, 2026 (applications reviewed on a rolling basis)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're excited to find someone who nerds out about clean books as much as we do. If that's you, hit send—let's build something great together.\n\r\n\n\r\nP.S. - If you're thinking \"This job posting is way too long\"... you're probably not detail-oriented enough for this role. If you're thinking \"I love how thorough this is—it shows they actually care about finding the right fit\"... we're going to get along great.????                ",

High-ticket projects, fast lead flow, zero fluff. We care about speed, clean comms, and booked shows.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe role:\n\r\nYou will own two critical parts of our operation. First, speed-to-lead. Your primary job is to call new leads in under five minutes, book qualified appointments, run confirmations and reschedules, and keep perfect notes inside our CRM (GoHighLevel). Second, you will act as our Onboarding Coordinator, guiding new clients through the setup process by managing communication and collecting necessary assets. This is not a technical role — our back-end team handles all deep GHL builds. Your focus is on speed, communication, and organization.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ll do:\n\r\n\n\r\n•Call and text every new lead within five minutes during assigned hours.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Run a first-hour follow-up cadence and keep touching until a clear yes/no.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Book qualified leads to the calendar, send confirmation messages immediately, and manage reschedules fast.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Execute a confirmation routine to protect show rate.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Maintain clean, searchable notes with outcome, next step, and due time.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Operate basic CRM settings: place calls, send SMS, move stages, trigger templates, and update contact fields.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Act as the main point of contact for new clients during onboarding, guiding them through asset collection (e.g., logos, account access) and scheduling their kickoff call.\n\r\n\n\r\n•End of day: send a short numbers report with attempts, bookings, shows/no-shows, and blockers.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you’ve ideally done in the past:\n\r\n\n\r\n•Proven setter or SDR experience handling inbound leads and calendar bookings.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Consistent speed-to-lead under five minutes during your last role.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Strong phone presence, clear English, confident pace, and concise objection handling.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Hands-on with a dialer/CRM (GHL or similar) for daily calling and SMS.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Track record of maintaining or improving show rates via confirmations and reschedules.\n\r\n\n\r\nHours, Pay, and Growth:\n\r\n\n\r\n•Pay: Starts at $500 USD/month.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Hours: Part-time, 9am–1pm Mountain Time (20 hours/week) coverage required.\n\r\n\n\r\n•Growth Path: This role is planned to become full-time (40 hours/week) on April 27th, with a corresponding increase in base pay. This is a long-term position with a clear path for promotion into a Client Success or Operations Management role as the company scales.
