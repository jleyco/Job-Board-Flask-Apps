We are also focused on the quality of life of our team and we support a healthy work-life balance.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for people who fit our values\n\r\n\n\r\nDo what you say – Nobody likes being let down and we think it’s key you don’t set unrealistic expectations. Seek to understand the importance of the task and any deadlines and agree realistic timescales and stick to them or communicate early regarding challenges.\n\r\n\n\r\nOpen and honest – Being a closed book doesn’t help anyone.

There will be occasions where you will need to go outside of the standard scope of your role to help out a colleague.

    "description": "\n                    About us\n\r\nWe are a premium skincare brand helping women 50+ finally see real, visible results in their skin.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur customers aren't naive first-time buyers. They're smart, skeptical women who have tried dozens of creams, serums, and devices that promised everything and delivered nothing. They've been disappointed so many times that they've almost stopped believing skincare can work for them.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur mission is to change that.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe sell in the Netherlands and Belgium – a professional-grade device that actually delivers ingredients into the skin instead of just sitting on top of it. But here's the thing: the product works. The challenge is getting women who've been burned before to believe it.\n\r\nThat's where you come in.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\nWe're looking for a Creative Strategist who can get inside the minds of our customers – not just understand them intellectually, but feel what they feel.\n\r\n\n\r\nThese women look in the mirror and think: \"I feel so much younger than I look.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThey're not vain. They're not chasing 25 again. They just want their outside to match how vibrant they feel inside. And they're tired of being sold empty promises by brands that don't understand them.\n\r\n\n\r\nYour job is to create ad concepts that make them stop scrolling and think: \"Finally, someone gets it.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn't about flashy editing or viral trends. It's about genuine connection. Our best-performing ads feel like advice from a trusted friend, not marketing from a corporation.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat You'll Do\n\r\nWeekly Output: 5-10 ad concepts\n\r\nEach concept includes:\n\r\n- The strategic angle (who we're talking to, what pain point, what desire)\n\r\n- The hook (first 3 seconds / first line)\n\r\n- The script or storyboard\n\r\n- Visual direction and references\n\r\n\n\r\nOngoing Responsibilities:\n\r\n- Research our target audience obsessively (reviews, comments, forums, competitor ads)\n\r\n- Study what's working in Meta Ads for DTC skincare and beauty brands\n\r\n- Analyze our ad performance data to understand what resonates and why\n\r\n- Build a swipe file of winning patterns you can adapt for our audience\n\r\n- Collaborate with our video editor and designer to bring concepts to life\n\r\n- Test different angles, hooks, and formats systematically\n\r\n- Document what works so we build institutional knowledge over time\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat We're Looking For\n\r\nRequired:\n\r\n- 1+ year of experience creating ad concepts for e-commerce brands\n\r\n- Strong understanding of direct response principles (you know why hooks matter, what makes people click, how to structure an ad for conversion)\n\r\n- Proficiency with AI tools (ChatGPT/Claude for research & copywriting, Foreplay/Atria for competitor analysis)\n\r\n- Ability to write compelling copy – not \"marketing speak,\" but words that sound human\n\r\n- Data literacy – you can look at ad metrics and extract insights\n\r\n- Fluent English (ads can be translated to Dutch with AI)\n\r\n- Reliable internet and ability to work independently\n\r\n\n\r\nBonus Points:\n\r\n- Experience with beauty, skincare, or wellness brands\n\r\n- Experience marketing to women 40+\n\r\n- Background in UGC strategy or working with creators\n\r\n- Familiarity with AI video tools (Mirage, Higgsfield, etc.)\n\r\n\n\r\nCharacter Traits That Matter\n\r\nThis role requires more than skills. It requires a certain way of thinking:\n\r\n- Empathy over ego. You genuinely care about understanding people, not just selling to them.\n\r\n- Curious and research-obsessed. You'd rather spend an hour reading product reviews than guessing what customers want.\n\r\n- Comfortable with nuance. Our audience is sophisticated. They see through cheap marketing tricks. You need to be smarter than that.\n\r\n- Honest and direct. If something isn't working, you say so. No sugarcoating.\n\r\n- Self-motivated. You don't need to be managed. You take ownership and deliver.\n\r\n- Iterative mindset. You see \"failures\" as data. You test, learn, adjust, repeat.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis Role is NOT For You If...\n\r\nWe're being direct because we respect your time:\n\r\n\n\r\n? You think \"anti-aging\" and \"look 10 years younger\" are good hooks. (Our audience hates this.)\n\r\n? You prefer trendy, Gen-Z style content. (Our customers are 50+, not 25.)\n\r\n? You want to copy what everyone else is doing. (Our market is saturated – we need fresh thinking.)\n\r\n? You care more about being clever than being clear.\n\r\n? You need constant direction and hand-holding.\n\r\n? You're not comfortable with feedback and iteration.\n\r\n? You think strategy and creativity are separate jobs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat's In It For You?\n\r\nCompensation:\n\r\n- Good compensation, depending on hours and experience\n\r\n- Potential to grow into a larger role with performance bonuses as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Opportunity:\n\r\n- Work directly with the founders, no layers of bureaucracy\n\r\n- We invest in you as a long-term tea\nmber... real training and mentorship... We want people who grow with us, not freelancers who disappear after a few months.\n\r\n- Real ownership of the creative strategy (not just executing someone else's ideas)\n\r\n- See your work drive real results (we share performance data transparently)\n\r\n- Learn what actually works in e-commerce advertising\n\r\n- Flexible hours – we care about output, not when you're online\n\r\n- Potential to grow into a larger role as we scale\n\r\n\n\r\nOur Culture:\n\r\nWe don't hire for quick fixes. We invest in you as a long-term tea\nmber, which means you'll receive real training and mentorship to become a great creative strategist. We want people who grow with us – not freelancers who disappear after a few months.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur values in practice:\n\r\n- Ownership – You are responsible for your work. You finish what you start.\n\r\n- Clarity – Say what you mean. Ask when you don't understand. Over-communicate rather than assume.\n\r\n- Speed with Care – Move fast, but thoughtfully. Quality comes first.\n\r\n- Collaboration – No one works alone. We help, support, improve.\n\r\n\n\r\nTools We Provide:\n\r\n- Foreplay/Atria for ad research\n\r\n- AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Mirage, Higgsfield)\n\r\n- Any reasonable tool you need to do great work\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to Apply\n\r\nSend us:\n\r\n- A brief intro – Who are you? Why does this role interest you?\n\r\n- 2-3 examples of ads you've created that actually performed well. Tell us the results if you can. (If you don't have e-commerce examples, show us something that demonstrates your strategic thinking.)\n\r\n\n\r\n?? A note on AI-generated applications: We work with AI tools every day – we know exactly what an AI-written application looks like. If your application is clearly generated by ChatGPT or Claude, we will not consider it. Write in your own voice.\n\r\nNo generic applications please. If your message could be sent to any company, we'll know.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe review applications within 5 business days and will respond to everyone, even if it's a no.\n\r\nLooking forward to meeting you.

This is great if you like working by yourself in the quiet, but it can be terribly painful if you need the energy of coworkers nearby.\n\r\nOur Cultural Values - We're an American company with an incredibly unusual culture. Even by American standards, our 7 cultural values are highly unusual. Our culture is challenging for people accustomed to corporate culture and especially difficult for people who grew up in Confucian cultures. It's a great culture for people who speak directly and have a great deal of self-confidence and ownership. If you identify as a misfit, you'll do well.\n\r\nMultiple Software Systems - You're going to need to learn how to use 12 different software systems. This is great if you want to get exposed to and experience lots of technology, but it can be tough if you have a hard time learning technology. Secret Message - When you apply, you'll see a box that asks if you want to add anything else. Type in PINK ELEPHANT in all capital letters exactly as we've shown it here.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCheat Code for getting a job with us:\n\r\n1) Our application comprises the majority of our recruiting process. Because of that, we suggest that you give us thoughtful responses and rich stories. We typically only interview applicants who give rich and detailed answers to our questions. If you write short responses so that you can hurry up and finish the application, you will not get interviewed.\n\r\n2) Tell us stories about how your actions match your beliefs and values. For example, if I say I value health and fitness, you don't know if I'm telling you the truth or if I'm just telling you what sounds good. But, if I tell you things I've done, I can illustrate my values of health and fitness with proof. For example, I go to the gym 4 days per week, I've done 6 triathlons, including an Ironman, and I can swim 3000 meters in one hour. My examples of things I've done prove that my actions match my values system.\n\r\n3) Be vulnerable and honest. We take very detailed notes during the interview process, and we conduct extensive background checks. If the stories you tell about yourself don't match what your references say, we will not hire you. We'd rather hire a C student who is honest about being a C student than someone who is a C student but tries to pass themselves off as an A student. Remember, this is an entry-level job. We're not looking for perfect. We're looking for an excellent cultural fit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nHow to apply: Please click on the link: \n/work-opportunities/administration-agent                ",

Skill matters, but alignment matters more.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you are just looking for another client, this is not for you.\n\r\nIf you get excited about helping an artist stay in her creative zone while her work reaches the people who need it most, keep reading.\n\r\nTracie’s Story\n\r\n\n\r\nTracie Fearing has been an artist for as long as she can remember.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen she was five years old, walking to kindergarten, her dad asked what she wanted to be when she grew up. Her answer came instantly. An artist. She never wanted to be anything else, and she never stopped choosing it, even when it wasn’t the practical path.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor Tracie, art isn’t about filling wall space. It’s about how people feel in their homes and in their lives.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen she paints, time disappears. It’s where she feels most alive, most grounded, and most herself. That depth shows up in her work. Her art brings calm, joy, and presence into the spaces people live in every day.\n\r\n\n\r\nShe believes real art carries energy that washes the daily stress and noise of life off our souls.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis isn’t about selling paintings. It’s about making the world a little more beautiful and a little more happy.\n\r\nThe Mission\n\r\n\n\r\nOur goal is simple.\n\r\n\n\r\nHelp Tracie’s art reach more people without pulling her out of her creative flow.\n\r\n\n\r\nThat means building a consistent, thoughtful social media presence that feels authentic to her work and values, not trendy, flashy, or generic.\n\r\nThe Role\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a Social Media Strategist and Content Partner.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is not just posting pretty images. You will help guide, shape, and execute the content strategy from start to finish.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou will work closely with Tracie so she can focus on creating art, while you focus on turning that process into meaningful content that connects with the right audience.\n\r\nWhat You’ll Be Responsible For\n\r\n\n\r\n• Helping guide what content to film and how to film it\n\r\n• Turning raw video into engaging short form content\n\r\n• Editing videos with music, pacing, and polish that fits Tracie’s aesthetic\n\r\n• Writing captions that feel human and aligned with her voice\n\r\n• Posting consistently across platforms\n\r\n• Understanding timing, trends, and basic algorithm behavior\n\r\n• Engaging with comments and helping maintain \nntum\n\r\n• Bringing creative ideas and direction, not just execution\n\r\n\n\r\nTracie’s only responsibility will be filming while she paints. You handle the rest.\n\r\nWhat This Role Is Not\n\r\n\n\r\n• Not a one off posting job\n\r\n• Not just scheduling content\n\r\n• Not someone who needs constant direction\n\r\n• Not “whatever is trending” content\n\r\n• Not rainbow, bubblegum, overly polished influencer aesthetics\n\r\n\n\r\nAuthenticity matters here.\n\r\nWho This Is For\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be a great fit if you:\n\r\n\n\r\n• Love art, creativity, and storytelling\n\r\n• Care about beauty, meaning, and emotional impact\n\r\n• Enjoy helping creatives stay in their zone\n\r\n• Are proactive and bring ideas to the table\n\r\n• Understand social media strategy and execution\n\r\n• Want to be part of a mission, not just a paycheck\n\r\nTime & Budget\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a monthly role.\n\r\n\n\r\nBudget range is approximately $500 to $1,000 per month, depending on experience and fit.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe right person matters more than the lowest price.\n\r\nApplication Process (Important)\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, you must complete all of the following. Incomplete applications will not be considered.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 1\n\r\nRecord a short video of yourself answering these two questions:\n\r\nIntroduce yourself and tell us a little about you\n\r\nWhy do you want to be part of Arete Artistry and this mission?\n\r\n\n\r\nWe want to hear your heart, not a script.\n\r\n\n\r\nStep 2\n\r\n the following to \n\r\n\n\r\n• Your video (or a link to it)\n\r\n• A link to your portfolio or examples of your work\n\r\n\n\r\nSubject line: Social Media Partner Application\n\r\nFinal Note\n\r\n\n\r\nThis role is for someone who wants to help spread more joy, beauty, and presence through art.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you read this and thought, “I want to be part of that,” we’d love to hear from you.
