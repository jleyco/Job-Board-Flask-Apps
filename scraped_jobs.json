My role is simply to help her find a rockstar, and once we find the perfect fit to place with her I will be out of the picture. (But here as support if either of you need me!)\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have found some fantastic tea\nmbers in the Philippines on my team, and I am on a mission to help some of our good friends in our business circles find the same without having to go through typical agencies.\n\r\n\n\r\nDr. Chris is an amazing entrepreneur. She is extremely sweet and kind, and would be a joy to work with! She has been a Chiropractor for many years (specializing working with kids) and is excited to bring a new line to her business offering laser work for weight loss and other benefits. She is very creative, energetic (you’ll see videos of her below doing aerial silks!) and loves being successful in business. \n\r\n\n\r\nYou can read more about her and her business at:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \n\r\n\n\r\nAs you can see, your help with managing her social media and posting content regularly will be greatly appreciated!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for a new Executive Assistant / GHL Expert to join her team full-time!

Would you like me to take that off of your plate?” That is the kind of person we are looking for!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe hours would be on a US schedule, Mon-Fri from 8:00 am until 5:00 pm Pacific time, with an hour lunch.

Someone who always goes the extra mile, not someone who does just enough to get by\n\r\n* Is comfortable working on TimeDoctor (similar to TimeProof) – it won’t be used to micro-manage, but rather just the opposite as a simple verification tool.\n\r\n* Is comfortable and happy working from home on your own with minimal supervision\n\r\n* Is comfortable asking a lot of questions for clarity rather than guessing, and will communicate right away if there are any issues, concerns, or questions\n\r\n\n\r\nWe are looking for someone who wants to stay with her long term!\n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply:\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease send me (Kayla) an\n to \n with the subject line:\n\r\n\n\r\n\"I'm **YOUR NAME**, Dr. Chris’s new Executive Assistant / GHL Expert!\"\n\r\n\n\r\nPlease include your resume attached as a PDF, as well as a direct link to your personal profile here on onlinejobs.ph, and please answer the following questions:\n\r\n\n\r\n1- What did you like most about your previous job(s)?\n\r\n2- What did you dislike about your previous job(s)?\n\r\n3- What you would like your next job to look like?

    "description": "\n                    Kamusta po! I am Jon, an American travel vlogger with a total following of over 900,000 across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and\n. I’m currently building a small in-house team located near Pasig to join me on my travels and help with recording, editing, and many other parts of the content creation process. My goal is to build something that feels less like a traditional job and more like a close-knit team that grows and travels together.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’ll start by focusing on localized short form content around 20-70 seconds long with minimal editing (mainly jump cuts and occasional blur effects). These videos usually take about an hour from start to finish, so we’ll aim for around 3-6 unique videos a day to repost across 8 different social media channels. Afterwards, we’ll begin to branch into long form content as we prepare for the first set of longer travels.\n\r\n\n\r\nYou do not need to have a lot of experience in content creation, and it’s totally okay if you’re shy around cameras. I was the same way when I first started making videos too. I’ll be working closely with you and teaching you everything step by step — all I ask is that you’re open-minded, willing to learn, and excited to grow with the team long-term.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThere will be a 3-part interview process:\n\r\n1. Online Conversation – We’ll start by chatting here or on Google Chat to clear up any misunderstandings and to begin learning more about each other.\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Video Call – Just a casual call to see if we get along. (Background noise like chickens, jeepneys, or karaoke is totally fine — I’ve been living in the Philippines for over a year now, so I’m used to it)\n\r\n\n\r\n3. In-Person Meet-Up & Casual Recording – We’ll meet up and do a short, relaxed recording together to see how our personalities work in real time. (Nothing scripted — just natural conversation)\n\r\n\n\r\nIf all 3 parts go well and both of us want to proceed, we will then spend around 2 weeks working closely together for training, building a workflow, and preparing for upcoming trips. During our travels, I will cover the costs for food, housing, transportation, and general travel expenses. In addition, each tea\nmber will receive a direct percentage of my top-performing channel’s revenues. This is paid work, and all details will be discussed transparently during the interview process.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIn conclusion, I’m looking for people who want to:\n\r\n- Join me on my travels\n\r\n- Help with all parts of the content creation process\n\r\n- Grow together as a team\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat’s included:\n\r\n- Paid role (revenue share from my top-performing channels)\n\r\n- Food, housing, and travel expenses covered during trips\n\r\n- Connections with brands and sponsors\n\r\n- Hands-on training and real-world experience\n\r\n- Opportunity to grow long-term with the team\n\r\n\n\r\nInterview process:\n\r\n- Short online chat\n\r\n- Casual video call to see if we get along\n\r\n- In-person meet-up with a short, relaxed recording (nothing scripted — just natural conversation)\n\r\n\n\r\nRequirements:\n\r\n- Open to learning new skills\n\r\n-  Positive, team-first attitude\n\r\n\n\r\nPreferred (not required):\n\r\n- Video editing experience\n\r\n- Social media experience\n\r\n- Located near Pasig\n\r\n\n\r\nIf this sounds like something you’d be interested in, send me a message and answer this question:\n\r\n- If we were traveling together and just finished filming all day, what would you do to relax?\n\r\n\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this — I’m really looking forward to building something incredible together as we travel, create, and entertain the world!\n\r\n\n\r\n- Jon                ",

We focus on helping each tea\nmber reach their full potential by investing in their learning, growth, skills, and education. When we grow as individuals, we succeed as a team.\n\r\n• Not a fan of office politics or drama? We’re on the same page. Instead of wasting time with that, we focus on solving problems and reaching goals\n\r\n• 100% remote, enjoy the comfort and flexibility of working from home\n\r\n\n\r\nPay, progression, and long-term growth:\n\r\n• Competitive salary\n\r\n• Benefits including up to 16 days a year Paid Time off\n\r\n• Progression as we grow: greater responsibilities, leadership opportunities, and increased pay.\n\r\n• Feel empowered, make decisions, have an impact\n\r\n• Grow with the company and live up to your potential!\n\r\n• Join an exciting, fast-growing company!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT US:\n\r\nWe’re a young, ambitious, and small (but growing!) company that’s making a massive impact in ecommerce. \n\r\n\n\r\nSince 2015 we’ve been obsessed with building award-winning products and awesome brands that people fall in love with. We have 2 primary brands in our portfolio: \n\r\n(1) an international award-winning coffee products brand \n / \n).\n\r\n(2) an educational coaching program that helps entrepreneurs grow their businesses to create a positive impact in the world!\n\r\n\n\r\nOur two recent flagship products became the world’s most successful launches in their categories. We’ve shipped more than 200,000 orders worldwide and we’re continuing to expand.\n\r\n\n\r\nOur culture is transparent and candid. You’re always welcome (and encouraged!) to ask questions or express a difference of opinion. Learning and growth is a cornerstone of our culture, both personally and professionally. We work hard, and we have fun!\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nWHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR:\n\r\nWe’re looking for a proactive and detail-oriented team player to fill this role—someone who thrives on solving problems, staying organized, and making things run smoothly across departments.\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you love helping customers, supporting a team, and keeping operations organized? Do you get satisfaction from making systems work better and “getting things done”? If yes, we want you on our team!\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re probably the type of person who:\n\r\n• Enjoys supporting others and finding solutions to problems\n\r\n• Has strong communication and organizational skills\n\r\n• Likes working behind the scenes to make sure everything runs like clockwork\n\r\n• Is excited to wear multiple hats and be part of a growing, fast-moving company\n\r\n• Has worked directly with founders or in a startup, and enjoys that fast-paced, flexible vibe\n\r\nWe’re not just looking for someone who can support our team, we’re looking for someone to be proactive with taking ownership of tasks, solve problems independently, and grow into larger responsibilities over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR OPPORTUNITY AND ROLE ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nOur culture is collaborative, friendly, and open. We hire people who are smart, ambitious, and have a strong desire to learn and grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nSound like you? This is an exciting long-term opportunity!\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a fully remote position. You’ll work directly with our founders and collaborate with our small but mighty team to support customer happiness, streamline operations, and take on projects that help the business grow. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a foundational role — one where you’ll gain visibility into all parts of the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you grow, your role will grow with you, based on your interests and strengths:\n\r\n• Want to work improving our systems and processes? Awesome!\n\r\n• Have ideas on how to improve our website? Fantastic!\n\r\n• Want to learn how to manage projects? Let’s go!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not just hiring for a role — we’re hiring for potential. \n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibilities will span 4 key areas: customer experience (30-40%), operations/logistics (20-30%), executive support (10-20%), and special projects (10-20%) — giving you exposure across the business. These percentages are estimates and you can expect your day-to-day to shift and evolve as the business grows and as you take ownership. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Customer Experience\n\r\n• Provide\n/chat-based support for our customers across our channels (Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale)\n\r\n• Answer order and product questions, resolve issues promptly, and ensure customers feel heard and supported\n\r\n• Support wholesale partners with order updates, invoicing, and coordination\n\r\n\n\r\n2. Order Management & Platform Coordination\n\r\n• Manage, monitor, and troubleshoot orders across Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale channels\n\r\n• Troubleshoot and resolve shipping or fulfillment issues with partners and customers\n\r\n• Maintain accurate product listings, inventory data, and logistics information across platforms\n\r\n\n\r\n3. Executive & Admin Support\n\r\n• Manage founder and team inboxes, schedule meetings, and organize internal documentation\n\r\n• Assist with travel bookings, meeting preparation, and note-taking\n\r\n• Support small projects by tracking timelines, managing tasks, and ensuring follow-through\n\r\n\n\r\n4. Special Projects & Company Operations\n\r\n• Conduct research projects to support decision-making (tools, systems, competitors)\n\r\n• Support lead generation efforts through identifying new wholesale prospects, brand partners, or influencers\n\r\n• Support planning and execution of events, expos, or marketing campaigns — manage timelines, logistics, and tasks\n\r\n• Document and maintain SOPs for operational clarity and training\n\r\n• Test and troubleshoot web pages, workflows, or customer journeys to ensure quality and functionality\n\r\n• Take ownership of ad hoc “figure it out” tasks — we’ll guide you, but we value initiative and independent problem-solving mindset\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’ll be trained on all platforms and tools, and we’ll support your learning — but we’re looking for someone who’s excited to take initiative and build systems along the way. This role evolves — as you grow, so will your responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / REQUIRED SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE:\n\r\nWe value curiosity, reliability, and the ability to take ownership. If you enjoy figuring things out, learning on the job, and taking initiative, you’ll thrive here. This role is not a fit if you need constant direction or struggle to manage your own time.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have experience:\n\r\n• 2+ years of experience in a customer service or operations support role \n/chat-based)\n\r\n• 1+ years experience in eCommerce environments (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)\n\r\n• Fluent in written and spoken English\n\r\n\n\r\nKey traits:\n\r\n• Strong detail orientation, organizational, and time-management skills — you’re detail-obsessed and on top of things\n\r\n• Proactive problem-solver — you take initiative, do the research, and follow through\n\r\n• Able to work independently, ask questions when needed, and communicate clearly\n\r\n• Comfortable with constructive feedback and direct, respectful communication\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional but a big plus:\n\r\n• Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus\n\r\n• Experience with executive assistant work \n/calendar/travel management)\n\r\n• Experience improving or documenting processes (SOPs)\n\r\n• Experience at a startup or small business where you wore multiple hats\n\r\n• “Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY, WORKING HOURS, HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nIf this description seems like it’s too intimidating for you, this position is probably not for you. However, if you’re still here reading and this sounds exciting for you, we’d love to meet you!\n\r\n\n\r\nThe full time monthly salary will be $\nbased on your skills and level of relevant experience. Being a member of our team has other benefits including up to 16 days of paid time off per year.\n\r\n\n\r\nWe understand you may have a busy schedule, so we’ve made our interview process extremely quick and efficient. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo apply, please follow the steps below:\n\r\n1. Get started with a quick Initial Screening here for us to get to know you: \n\r\n2. Complete the screening and we’ll be in touch with next steps once we receive it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe position is on a first come first review basis, so the sooner you complete the screening, the more likely you'll get hired.\n\r\n\n\r\nGood luck, and we hope to have someone awesome like you to join us!

    "description": "\n                    About Oprisa GmbH: We are a rapidly expanding German company managing a massive fleet of couriers for major Food Delivery Platform across Germany. We operate in a high-speed environment where compliance is just as important as recruitment.\n\r\n\n\r\nJob Summary: We are looking for a \"Gatekeeper\". While our Recruiters are the \"Hunters\" bringing people in, you are the \"Shield\" that protects the company. Your main mission is Compliance & Data Integrity. You will manage the onboarding of hundreds of drivers, audit their documents daily, and ensure that our Google Drive/Database is 100% audit-proof for German authorities.\n\r\n\n\r\nKey Responsibilities:\n\r\n\n\r\nThe \"Uber Audit\" Defense: Review every single driver document (ID, Work Permit, Licenses) for validity and clarity before activation.\n\r\n\n\r\nDatabase Management: Own the Master Sheet. Ensure every cell is filled, every file is renamed correctly in Dropbox, and every expiration date is tracked.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnboarding Execution: Generate contracts, send welcome packs, and chase drivers for missing signatures.\n\r\n\n\r\nCompliance Enforcer: If a driver’s ID is expired, you flag it immediately. You do not let \"bad data\" enter the system.\n\r\n\n\r\nReporting: Assist the Fleet Manager in generating weekly headcount and compliance reports.\n\r\n\n\r\nRequired Qualifications:\n\r\n\n\r\nEagle Eye for Detail: You spot a typo or an expired date from a mile away. You hate messy spreadsheets.\n\r\n\n\r\nExperience: Proven background in HR Admin, Data Entry, or Compliance Support (BPO experience preferred).\n\r\n\n\r\nTech Stack: Comfortable with Google Sheets (Filter, Sort, basic Formulas), Dropbox/Google Drive organization, and Slack.\n\r\n\n\r\nCommunication: Assertive English. You need to tell drivers (and sometimes managers) \"No, this document is not good enough.\"\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Offer:\n\r\n\n\r\nStable Salary: $500 - $700 USD/Month (based on experience).\n\r\n\n\r\nLow Stress, High Focus: Unlike phone support, this role focuses on documents and data accuracy.\n\r\n\n\r\nLong-Term Security: We are looking for someone to stay and grow with our Operations team.\n\r\n\n\r\nSchedule:\n\r\n\n\r\nFull-Time (40 Hours/Week).\n\r\n\n\r\nMust overlap 4-5 hours with German Business Time (Afternoon/Evening in Philippines).\n\r\n\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY: Please apply directly through this platform. Note: To prove your attention to detail, please start your cover letter/message with the exact phrase: \"I AM THE GATEKEEPER\". Applications without this phrase will be ignored.\n\r\n\n\r\nSkills Required:\n\r\nAdmin Assistant\n\r\nData Entry\n\r\nHR Management\n\r\nGoogle Suite (Docs, Sheets)\n\r\nAttention to Detail\n\r\nEnglish (Writing)                ",

We run intimate, all-inclusive food tours across Italy for women — think handmade pasta in Tuscany, truffle hunting in Bologna, rooftop dinners in Rome. We're a small, tight-knit remote team that's growing fast (11 tours this year, 17 next year) and we take hospitality seriously. Our guests pay premium prices and expect a flawless experience.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy This Role is Different\n\r\n\n\r\nMost companies hiring remote coordinators hand you a mess and say \"figure it out.\" Not us. We've built detailed systems, checklists, and templates for everything. Your job isn't to create the process — it's to own it, run it perfectly, and flag anything that needs attention. If you're the kind of person who loves checking every box and sleeping well knowing nothing slipped through the cracks, this role was made for you.\n\r\nYou'll work directly with our CEO and a small operations team.

We have 2 primary brands in our portfolio: \n\r\n(1) an international award-winning coffee products brand \n / \n).\n\r\n(2) an educational coaching program that helps entrepreneurs grow their businesses to create a positive impact in the world!\n\r\n\n\r\nOur two recent flagship products became the world’s most successful launches in their categories.

Do you get satisfaction from making systems work better and “getting things done”? If yes, we want you on our team!\n\r\n\n\r\nYou’re probably the type of person who:\n\r\n• Enjoys supporting others and finding solutions to problems\n\r\n• Has strong communication and organizational skills\n\r\n• Likes working behind the scenes to make sure everything runs like clockwork\n\r\n• Is excited to wear multiple hats and be part of a growing, fast-moving company\n\r\n• Has worked directly with founders or in a startup, and enjoys that fast-paced, flexible vibe\n\r\nWe’re not just looking for someone who can support our team, we’re looking for someone to be proactive with taking ownership of tasks, solve problems independently, and grow into larger responsibilities over time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYOUR OPPORTUNITY AND ROLE ON THE TEAM:\n\r\nOur culture is collaborative, friendly, and open. We hire people who are smart, ambitious, and have a strong desire to learn and grow.\n\r\n\n\r\nSound like you? This is an exciting long-term opportunity!\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a fully remote position. You’ll work directly with our founders and collaborate with our small but mighty team to support customer happiness, streamline operations, and take on projects that help the business grow. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a foundational role — one where you’ll gain visibility into all parts of the company.\n\r\n\n\r\nAs you grow, your role will grow with you, based on your interests and strengths:\n\r\n• Want to work improving our systems and processes? Awesome!\n\r\n• Have ideas on how to improve our website? Fantastic!\n\r\n• Want to learn how to manage projects? Let’s go!\n\r\n\n\r\nWe’re not just hiring for a role — we’re hiring for potential. \n\r\n\n\r\nYour responsibilities will span 4 key areas: customer experience (30-40%), operations/logistics (20-30%), executive support (10-20%), and special projects (10-20%) — giving you exposure across the business. These percentages are estimates and you can expect your day-to-day to shift and evolve as the business grows and as you take ownership. \n\r\n\n\r\n1. Customer Experience\n\r\n• Provide\n/chat-based support for our customers across our channels (Shopify, Amazon, and wholesale)\n\r\n• Answer order and product questions, resolve issues promptly, and ensure customers feel heard and supported\n\r\n• Support wholesale partners with order updates, invoicing, and coordination\n\r\n\n\r\n2.

This role evolves — as you grow, so will your responsibilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nABOUT YOU / REQUIRED SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE:\n\r\nWe value curiosity, reliability, and the ability to take ownership. If you enjoy figuring things out, learning on the job, and taking initiative, you’ll thrive here. This role is not a fit if you need constant direction or struggle to manage your own time.\n\r\n\n\r\nMust have experience:\n\r\n• 2+ years of experience in a customer service or operations support role \n/chat-based)\n\r\n• 1+ years experience in eCommerce environments (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)\n\r\n• Fluent in written and spoken English\n\r\n\n\r\nKey traits:\n\r\n• Strong detail orientation, organizational, and time-management skills — you’re detail-obsessed and on top of things\n\r\n• Proactive problem-solver — you take initiative, do the research, and follow through\n\r\n• Able to work independently, ask questions when needed, and communicate clearly\n\r\n• Comfortable with constructive feedback and direct, respectful communication\n\r\n\n\r\nOptional but a big plus:\n\r\n• Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus\n\r\n• Experience with executive assistant work \n/calendar/travel management)\n\r\n• Experience improving or documenting processes (SOPs)\n\r\n• Experience at a startup or small business where you wore multiple hats\n\r\n• “Experience coordinating projects, events, or marketing campaigns is a plus”\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nPAY, WORKING HOURS, HOW TO APPLY\n\r\nIf this description seems like it’s too intimidating for you, this position is probably not for you.
